#### Register a GitHub account

__Do this first!__

  * Register for a free individual GitHub account and request [the student discount](https://education.github.com). This should give you some free private repositories for a couple of years. Do this ASAP! I think a human vets these requests, so it could take a couple of ~~days~~ months.
    - As with Twitter (see below), think before you set up your public profile. I suggest you use a real name and begin to build a scholarly identity in social media and coding, but it's a decision you should make with intention.
  * We will elicit your GitHub username soon so we can add you to the [STAT 545 GitHub Organization](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/).

#### R and RStudio

Follow [these instructions](block000_r-rstudio-install.html). Eventually we will want you to connect RStudio and Git(Hub) (see next item about installing Git), so if things are going really well, give that a try.

If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, we **highly recommend** that you reinstall and upgrade to the most recent version. It is very easy and RStudio, specifically, is changing rapidly and positively (written 2015-09). If you upgrade R, you will need to also update any packages you have installed.

#### Git(Hub) and Git client

  * **You can wait a couple days to do this if all the rest is overwhelming.** But at least read the pages I link to here and start to prepare your mind.
  * [Working with RStudio, Git, GitHub](git00_index.html)

#### Twitter

<https://twitter.com>  

I will use the [\@STAT545](https://twitter.com/STAT545) Twitter account to make micro-announcements, share interesting links, and facilitate a conversation amongst ourselves __in public__.

In class, we talk about Twitter, its scholarly use, and privacy. Some relevant links:

  * [Disposable Twitter Accounts for Classroom Use](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/disposable-twitter-accounts-for-classroom-use/40145) from ProfHacker on the Chronicle of Higher Education
    -  Good quote: "I strongly encourage you to create a disposable account if for any reason you prefer not to share your personal account for classroom activities."
  * [Resources for exploring digital identity, privacy and authenticity](http://catherinecronin.wordpress.com/2012/02/29/525/) from Catherine Cronin
  * [Some advice to young graduate students](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/advice-to-graduate-students.html) from C. Titus Brown
  * [How to be the grad student your advisor brags about](http://blog.impactstory.org/how-to-be-the-grad-student-your-advisor-brags-about/) from the blog of Impactstory
  * [10 Commandments of Twitter for Academics](http://chronicle.com/article/10-Commandments-of-Twitter-for/131813/) from Do Your Job Better on the Chronicle of Higher Education
  * [Using Twitter in university research, teaching and impact activities: A guide for academics and researchers](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/files/2011/11/Published-Twitter_Guide_Sept_2011.pdf) *note: links to a PDF*

If you choose not to get a Twitter account, you will want to visit the [\@STAT545 profile page](https://twitter.com/STAT545) regularly to see what's up.

If you set up (or already have a Twitter account), you should follow [\@STAT545](https://twitter.com/STAT545). We will elicit your Twitter handle soon so we can follow you back.

You could also follow me as an individual, at [\@JennyBryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan). Ditto for the course TAs. You can learn some good people to follow re: data science and R by looking at who we follow and who we have Twitter conversations with.

#### RPubs

<http://rpubs.com>

This is a free hosting service provided by RStudio. It is the fastest way to get a report up on the web, based on an R script or an R Markdown file. But I think its days are numbered. Still, we may use this a little before we move on to other techniques. Registering for a free account is a "nice to do", not a "must do".
