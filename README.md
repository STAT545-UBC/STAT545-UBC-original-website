The old repository for the website of STAT 545 @ University of British Columbia, a course in data wrangling, exploration, and analysis with R.

This repo is no longer in use and has been archived (as of mid-September 2019).

Most STAT 545 content is now available from a new website at the usual domain:

[stat545.com](https://stat545.com)

The source for the new website is here:
