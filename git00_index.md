### Level 1: Installation

  * [Register a free GitHub account](https://github.com). If you are eligible, you may want to take advantage of the offers available at [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com).
  * [Install R and RStudio](block000_r-rstudio-install.html)
  * [Install Git](git01_git-install.html)
  * [Install a Git client](git02_git-clients.html) *optional but recommended*

### Level 2: Git and GitHub configuration

  * [Introduce yourself to Git](git04_introduce-self-to-git.html)
  * [Test connection to GitHub](git05_github-connection.html)

### Level 3: RStudio and Git and GitHub Extravaganza

  * [Test connection between RStudio and GitHub](git07_git-github-rstudio.html)
  * [Tell RStudio where to find Git](git03_rstudio-meet-git.html)
  * [GitHub credential caching](git06_credential-caching.html)
  * [Take possession of your STAT 545 repo](git08_claim-stat545-repo.html)
  
### Level 666: Troubleshooting

  * [RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell](git66_rstudio-git-github-hell.html)

### Resources

We practice what we preach! This entire website is created with the tools and workflows described above. Go ahead and [watch us work](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io).

Long-term, you should understand more about what you are doing. Rote clicking in RStudio may be a short-term survival method but won't work for long.

  * [trygit](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is to (command line) Git as [swirl](http://swirlstats.com) is to R. Learn by doing, in small bites.

  * The book [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) is fantastic and comprehensive.

  * [GitHub's own training materials](http://training.github.com/kit/) may be helpful.

    - They also point to [many other resources](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-other-good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github)

  * Find a [powerful Git client](git02_git-clients.html) if you'd like to minimize your usage of Git from the command line.
  
  * The [Curated Git Links of 2014](http://thelinell.com/2014/12/23/curated-git-links-of-2014/) collected by Linell Bonnette range "from easy fixes to (mindblown)". They might help you get out of some common pickles as your usage becomes more advanced.
  
  * It's not you, it's Git! If you're not crying already, these fictional-but-realistic Git man pages should do the trick: [git-man-page-generator](http://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net)
