# Syllabus



Overview:

  * STAT 545 = 7 weeks
  * STAT 547 = 6 weeks
  * First 7 + 2 = 9 weeks is general data wrangling, exploration, analysis
  * Last 4 weeks = 4 one-week self-contained intermediate topics:
    - Build your first R package
    - Build a Shiny app
    - Get data from the web (scraping and APIs)
    - Automate tasks and pipelines

Office hours:

  * Every Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00-12:00 in ESB 3174 (right after class!)
  * Bonus office hour! Wednesday, September 6, 12:00-13:00 in ESB 3174.
  * Vincenzo will be available at ESB 3152 every Wednesday from 11:00-12:00, ending on December 13, 2017.
  * The duration and/or days will likely be decreased as term goes on. We will leave [this issue open on GitHub](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/495) for discussion and late-breaking updates, like office hours are cancelled or have ended early due to no interest.
