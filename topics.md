### Course material

  * [Class meeting 001](cm001_course-intro-sw-install-account-signup.html) deals with "What is data science? What is data carpentry?" and includes links re: use of Twitter in academia.

  * [Class meeting 004](cm004_care-feeding-data.html) Data.frames are awesome. Let's explore one (Gapminder).
  * [Class meeting 005](cm005_still-data-ggplot2-rmarkdown.html) Continue exploring data in a data.frame, maybe using `ggplot2` and in an R Markdown document
  * [Class meeting 006](cm006_q-and-a-more-ggplot2.html) Open Q and A on all content and course mechanics so far, complete introduction to `ggplot2`
  * [Class meeting 007](cm007_dplyr-intro.html) Introduction to `dplyr`
  * [General homework guidelines](hw00_homework-guidelines.html)
  * [General homework rubric](peer-review01_marking-rubric.html) to apply in peer review

  * [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html) Edit `README.md`
  * [Homework 02](hw02_explore-gapminder-use-rmarkdown.html) Explore Gapminder and use R markdown
  * [Homework 03](hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html) Manipulate and summarize the Gapminder data with `dplyr`; make companion figs with `ggplot2`

### Short random things

  * [Lesson I contributed](bit002_tidying-lotr-data.html) to [Data Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/05/our-first-data-carpentry-workshop.html) on tidying data
  * [Cheatsheet](bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html) for `dplyr` join functions

### What's coming

Topics traditionally covered in STAT 545A, with light updating:

  * ~~Introduction to R and the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)~~ *done*
  * ~~R scripts and workspaces, RStudio Projects; how to get your work done~~ *done*
  * ~~Creating reports from R scripts and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), using [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/)~~ *done*
  * ~~Deep thoughts about data analytic work~~ *done*
  * ~~Care and feeding of data in R; data frames~~ *done*
  * ~~R objects -- beyond data frames~~ *done*
  * ~~Indexing, subsetting~~ *done*
  * Data aggregation; "apply" functions, [`plyr`](http://plyr.had.co.nz), ~~[`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr)~~
  * ~~Making figures with `ggplot2` (was `lattice` in past)~~ *done*
  * How to help yourself, how to ask questions to get useful answers
  * How to get data in and out of R, staying as "open" as possible
  * How to get figures out of R
  * Be the boss of your factors, i.e. categorical variables
  * Use of color in R
  * Single quantitative variable: visualizations and descriptive statistics
  * Two quantitative variables: visualizations and descriptive statistics
  * Categorical variables: visualizations and descriptive statistics
  * Multivariate visualizations
  * Visualizing and summarizing data when "grouped"
  * Coding style and project organization
  
New topics for STAT 545A and/or STAT 547M will be selected from here:

  * Bash shell / unix basics, personal system administration.
  * Version control with Git, collaboration via [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * The tabular data mentality, "tidy" data, data reshaping
  * Regular expressions, programmatic transformation and searching of character data
  * Writing R functions
  * Creating interactive pages, apps, and graphics via [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) and (maybe) [`ggvis`](http://ggvis.rstudio.com)
  * Unit testing, at least as a mentality. Maybe will cover formal unit testing, e.g. `testthat`
  * Stats particularly useful in exploration (and often neglected in standard intro stats courses)
    - robust summary statistics
    - robust regression
    - smoothing
    - density estimation
    - cluster analysis, PCA, SVD, MDS
  * Embrace the web:
    - getting data from the web, e.g. using an API or via scraping
    - exposing your hard work on the web (data, code, results)
  * Distributing data and code to the world via an R package
  * Automating an analytical pipeline, e.g. via `Make`.
