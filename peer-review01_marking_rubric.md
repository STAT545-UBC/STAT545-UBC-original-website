# Marking rubric:


Topic| Excellent: <br> ✓+ coded as +  | Satisfactory: <br> ✓ coded as 0  |Needs work: <br> ✓- coded as - |
|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|Coding style| Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable|
|Coding strategy| Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors  | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors. |   Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors. |
|Presentation: graphs | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions. |
|Presentation: tables | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features. | Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.| Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.|
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.|Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.|Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.|
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work|Access as easy as possible, code runs! | Satisfactory | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions  and/or code does not run|
