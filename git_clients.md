### What and why

Learning how and why to use version control can be rough at first. I found the use of a GUI – as opposed to the command line – extremely helpful when I was getting started. I call this sort of helper application a Git client.

Git and your Git client are not the same thing, just like R and RStudio are not the same thing. A Git client and the RStudio IDE are not necessary to use to Git or R, respectively, but they make the experience more pleasant.

RStudio offers a very basic Git client. I use this often for simple operations, but you probably want another, more powerful one as well.

Fair warning: for some things, you will have to use the command line. But the more powerful your Git client is, the less often this happens.


### Recommendations for Git clients

* [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) is a free, powerful Git(Hub) client that I highly recommend. It was my first Git client and is still my favorite for nontrivial Git tasks.

* GitHub also offers a free, powerful Git(Hub) client for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac](https://mac.github.com/).

* A free multi-platform Git(Hub) client is [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/).

* Browse [even more Git(Hub) clients](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).
