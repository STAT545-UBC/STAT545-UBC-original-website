### cm111 2017-11-30 Thursday overview

*aspirational placeholder right now!*

  * [Homework 8 Build a Shiny app](hw08_shiny.html): peer review open.
  * [Homework 9 Build your own R package](hw09_package.html) is due next Monday, December 4, if you do it.
  * [Homework 10 Get data from the web](hw10_data-from-web.html) is due **the following Friday, December 8**, if you do it, because we need to finalize marks.
    - For the homework, I'll offer lots of prompts, including what you see in last year's version, so you can choose to work with a wrapped or unwrapped API or webscraping.
  * This week is about accessing data from the web from R. In class, we'll be mostly following materials prepared by Karthik Ram and Scott Chamberlain (rOpenSci) and Garrett Grolemund (Rstudio):

    - <https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/tree/master/31-Web-APIs>
