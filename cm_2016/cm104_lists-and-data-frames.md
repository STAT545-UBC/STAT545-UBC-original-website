A homework will be assigned for the past 4 lectures. Later today or, at the latest, tomorrow.

Look out for instructions on the [Discussion board](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) re: s/w install for next week. It's also pre-emptively related to creating an R package.

Data frames that hold lists and lists that contain data frames. We continue to work (mostly) out of my purrr tutorial:

  * <https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/>
    * [Specifying the function in map() + parallel mapping](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls03_map-function-syntax.html)
    * [List as variable in a data frame](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls20_nested-data-frame.html)
  * [Split-Apply-Combine](block024_group-nest-split-map.html) *here in STAT 545*
