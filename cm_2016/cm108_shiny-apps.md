### cm108 2016-11-17 Thursday overview

You should have completed sections 1-8 on the [Shiny Tutorial](shiny01_activity.html) prior to today. 

Today we will pick up where we left off: [Shiny tutorial part 2](http://stat545.com/shiny01_activity.html#implement-server-logic-to-create-outputs).

We'll also be using [this etherpad](https://beta.etherpad.org/p/cm108-shiny) for real-time Q&A and code sharing. If you need to share some code or send a chat message to the instructor or other classmates, feel free to use that webpage. This will make it easier to ask Dean questions, or let other students see that you're having the same problem as them. Students can also help other students through the chat.
