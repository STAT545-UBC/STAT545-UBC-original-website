### cm103 2016-11-01 Tuesday overview

  * Pre-req: [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html) *remember? we did that back in STAT 545*
  * We will work out of my purrr tutorial: https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/
    - [Vectors and lists](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/bk00_vectors-and-lists.html) *good review if  STAT 545 lecture was not enough*
    - [Simplifying data from a list of GitHub users](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls03_github-api-json.html) **Our main live-coding activity**
    - [Basic mapping with Wes Anderson and Game of Thrones](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls01_map-basics.html) *will be similar to the GitHub example, but hopefully more fun ... but still incomplete*
    - [Trump Android words](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls02_trump-tweets.html) *I'm sure we won't get to this but after class you should be able to work through on your own*
