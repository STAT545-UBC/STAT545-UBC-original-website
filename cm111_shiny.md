  * Today's activity: [Build a Shiny app with BC Liquor Store dataset](shiny01_activity.html)
    * Today we are only adding code to the UI, so only work until [the checkpoint](shiny01_activity.html#checkpoint-what-our-app-looks-like-after-implementing-the-ui). On Thursday we will add code to the server, so we'll start after the checkpoint.
