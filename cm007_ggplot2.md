  * You should submit [Homework 02](hw02_explore-gapminder-dplyr.html) today.
  * You should submit [Homework 03](hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html) sometime next Tuesday October 3.
  * Are you an auditor? Official or unofficial? Please declare your intention to take part in peer review or not! I will assume you are OUT if I don't hear from you.
    - Go here: <https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/2017_hw-peer-review#readme> *this link will only work for members of the 2017 STAT 545 students team!* -- but is currently not active.
  * Today we complete our introduction to ggplot2.
    - We'll get through as much as we can from Jenny's [`ggplot2` tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial).
    - Whatever we don't cover, remains as a resource you can draw on in future.
  * The [Data visualisation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) chapter in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) is an excellent brief introduction to ggplot2.
  * Thursday we complete our coverage of dplyr functions for working with a single table.
