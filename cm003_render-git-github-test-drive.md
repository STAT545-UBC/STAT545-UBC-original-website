  * Revisit toy line script from last class, which covered:
    - [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)

  * Work on "Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio" and "Early GitHub Usage" from  <http://happygitwithr.com>
    - If you see slides, they'll be something like these:  <https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user>
