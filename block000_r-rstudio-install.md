### R and RStudio

* Install [R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics](http://www.r-project.org) from [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is __highly recommended__ to install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the top of the CRAN page linked above!

* Install RStudio's IDE (stands for _integrated development environment_), a powerful user interface for R. Get the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop: <http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/>
    - RStudio comes with a __text editor__, so there is no immediate need to install a separate stand-alone editor.
    - RStudio can __interface with Git(Hub)__. However, you must do all the Git(Hub) set up described elsewhere before you can take advantage of this.
    
If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, we highly recommend that you reinstall and upgrade to the most recent version. It is very easy and RStudio, specifically, is changing rapidly and positively (written 2014-09). If you upgrade R, you will need to also update any packages you have installed.

### Testing testing

* Do whatever is appropriate for your OS to launch RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see [here](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png), but yours will be more boring because you haven't written any code or made any figures yet!

* Put your cursor in the pane labelled Console, which is where you interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the `x` object by typing `x` followed by enter or return. You should see the value 8 print to screen. If yes, you've succeeded in installing R and RStudio.

### Add-on packages

R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a _package_ via CRAN and GitHub. To install a package from CRAN, for example the [`plyr`](http://plyr.had.co.nz)  package for data aggregation, here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others).

```
  install.packages("plyr", dependencies = TRUE)
```

By including `dependencies = TRUE`, we are being explicit and extra-careful to install any additional packages the target package, `plyr` in the example above, needs to have around.

You could use the above method to install the following packages, all of which we will use:

  * `plyr`, [package webpage](http://plyr.had.co.nz)
  * `knitr` [package webpage](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
  * `ggplot2` [package webpage](http://docs.ggplot2.org/)
