LOTR R Markdown file
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. In this example, its purpose is to allow us to demonstrate how to use `rmarkdown` (or `knitr`) without the help of RStudio's buttons. We will, in fact, call a `rmarkdown` (or `knitr`) function from within a Makefile.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
lotrDat <- read.delim("lotr_clean.tsv")
## infer order of Race and Film factors from order in file
lotrDat <-
  within(lotrDat, {
    Race <- factor(as.character(Race), levels = unique(lotrDat$Race))
    Film <- factor(as.character(Film), levels = unique(lotrDat$Film))
  })
## WARNING: probably not a safe long-run strategy for communicating factor level
## order with plain text data files; I see no guarantees that unique() return 
## value will be in any particular order; I have just noticed anecdotally that
## return value is in order of appearance
```

Here is a plot we are making "on the fly" via code in an R chunk.
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
theFilm <- levels(lotrDat$Film)[2]
p <- ggplot(lotrDat, aes(x = Race, y = Words)) + scale_y_log10() +
  ggtitle(paste(theFilm, "(made from code in R Markdown)")) + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 1/2, position = position_jitter(width = 0.1))
print(p)
```

Here is a pre-made plot we are merely embedding in the compiled document.
