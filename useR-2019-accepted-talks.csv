"Kosmidis Ioannis";"trackeRapp: An integrated shiny workflow for the analysis of running, cycling and swimming data";"Recent technological advances have allowed the frequent and simultaneous measurement of multiple aspects of athletic activities, like running, cycling and swimming in high frequency, at a small cost and through a wealth of devices. The resulting data are increasingly being used by not only elite sports teams but also recreational athletes to quantify and track aspects of their activity and performance through time. In this talk, we will present the trackeRapp R package, which is the first shiny interface for the analysis and tracking of athletic activity data in R. trackeRapp builds on the extensive infrastructure provided by the trackeR R package and offers a user-friendly, web-interface that implements an integrated workflow for the analysis of sports data from GPS-enabled tracking devices through flexible and extensive interactive visualisations and data-analytic tools. trackeRapp offers functionality to import data from raw activity files of popular formats (tcx, gpx, json and db3), clean them, organised them and finally export images of processed activity data that can be used for further analysis not only within the interface but also for more advanced modelling in R. We will introduce the interface and its capabilities through a live demonstration, and we will present the challenges we faced whilst developing it and our future plans.";"oral presentation"
"Scheffer Annette";"Navigating spatial data management and analysis in Sustainable Fisheries using a combined R ? Python approach";"Geospatial data is of increasing importance in resource management, impact assessment and decision-making. However, the variety of requirements and user experience when working with spatial data - from developing data visualisations through graphical interfaces to undertaking analyses with customized coding - necessitates tailored solutions to maximize accessibility of data and analysis tools for different user groups. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is a non-profit organization providing an internationally recognized sustainable seafood ecolabel and fishery and traceability certification programs. The nature of such an organization means that multiple departments have different requirements and coding proficiency, requiring that the MSC's spatial data management and analysis strategy accommodates a variety of access and analysis tools. Here, we discuss the implementation of spatial data storage, organisation and analysis at the MSC in light of maximizing accessibility, workflow efficiency and reproducibility of results. Our implementation combines open-source analysis tools such as R, Python and qGIS together with PostgreSQL for spatial data management. R and Python scripts combined under the rPython package allow connecting to the spatial database via R or qGIS and automating repeated processes such as specific queries and analyses.";"lightning talk"
"Arabzadeh Rezgar";"Application of WRSS in Water and Energy Analysis; An object oriented R package for large-scale water resources operation";"Water Resources Simulator, an object-oriented open-source software package based on R language, is developed for simulation of water resources systems based on Standard Operation Policy. In spite of numerous commercially available software packages for modeling and simulation of water resources systems, only a limited number of free and open source tools are available in this regard. This acted as the initiative for the development of WRSS which enables water resources engineers to study and assess water resources projects by modeling and simulation. This package provides users a number of functions and methods to build a model, manipulate its components, simulate the scenarios and publish and visualize the results in a water resource system study. WRSS is capable to incorporate various components of a large and complex supply-demand system as well as hydropower analysis for reservoirs since they have not been available in any other R packages. In addition, a particular coding system, devised for WRSS, allows water resources component to interact together by transferring mass in terms of seepage, leakage, spillage, and return flow. In addition to its capabilities, the package was successfully applied to a case study of a water resources system composed of 5 reservoirs and 11 demand sites and the results proved the role of WRSS in the enhancement of the dam operation under the large-scale model.";"oral presentation"

 Calculation strategies ranging from very classic old-fashion hard-coding, optimization of traditional R functions and application of Rcpp are illustrated as we assess performance and precision of different implementations of Bessel functions in both tables and graphics. Precision and speed of calculations are related to identifiability and optimization problems within the family of generalized hyperbolic distribution and recent developments.";"poster"
"Joo Rocio";"Navigating through the R packages for movement";"The advent of biologging devices has led to the collection of ever-increasing quantities of tracking data from animals and humans. In parallel, sophisticated tools to process, visualize and analyze tracking data have been developed in abundance. Within the R software, we listed 57 packages focused on these tasks, called here tracking packages.
Here we review and describe each package based on a workflow centered around tracking data, broken down in three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis (data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioral pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others). 
Links between packages are assessed through a network graph analysis and show that one third of the packages worked on isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the R movement-ecology programming community. 
Finally, we provide recommendations for users to choose packages and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links between the programming community.";"oral presentation"

Packages built on RMarkdown such as posterdown, xaringan, pagedown, and rticles allow for most aspects of a typical research project to be produced; however, newcomers to RMarkdown can be put off or discouraged by the inconsistencies in which each type of document needs to be formatted in the '.Rmd' file. This talk will provide insight into the benefits and downfalls of fully customizable RMarkdown packages with emphasis on (1) the importance of a timely workflow for the short duration of an average graduate student program; (2) introducing students or supervisors who are new to RMarkdown, and (3) show the importance of reproducibility in every stage of a good research project. Concepts from this presentation intend to spark conversation and show the importance of reproducible document generation in all stages of a research project.  ";"lightning talk"

There is however always limited budget for welfare services and care resources, so it should be efficiently managed and utilised. To address these challenges, we attempt to identify neighbourhoods where elderly people in need are concentrated using spatial segregation measures in R. We assess whether low-income seniors or those who live alone are geographically isolated in certain areas using the spatial exposure index implemented in the seg package and then visualise the results. If the old people are isolated in a few administrative zones, the accessibility of medical services, community centres and grocery stores for those living in the areas are evaluated. This process will be implemented as a function in R so it can assist policy-makers by quickly suggesting areas that needs more investment.";"poster"

"Seynaeve Daan";"rjenkins and rrundeck: Coordinating Continuous Integration and Delivery with R";"Continuous integration is a software development practice that advocates for members of a team to merge their work frequently in a shared repository. Each integration is verified through a process of automated building and testing. This process can be facilitated through the use of a build server. A popular choice is Jenkins: a free and open source automation server. Continuous delivery is an extension of the continuous integration principle that asks that every successfully built version of the software is put into a staging environment from where it can easily be deployed to a production setting. The deployment process is still manual but it can be simplified through the use of self-service operations. Rundeck is an open source management platform that allows to define such self-service operations. We propose two new R packages: rjenkins and rrundeck. These packages interact with the Web APIs offered by Jenkins and Rundeck to easily create, trigger and monitor jobs and operations. This provides R users with an intuitive interface to these tools which can be used in an interactive or scripted way.";"oral presentation"
"Zhao Allan";"prVis: a Novel Method for Visual Dimension Reduction";"Visualization is an invaluable tool for gaining insight into complex high-dimensional data. Here we introduce prVis: a polynomial-based 2-D visualization method. PrVis, or polynomial visualization, captures potential nonlinear relationships in datasets by performing polynomial expansion and applying PCA on the resulting expanded polynomials. Our method produces an arguably better outcome on the famous Swiss Roll test case than do t-sne, UMAP, and ordinary PCA, and generally does as well or better than those methods on other datasets. PrVis offers options to further investigate how the clusters of data relate to the original variables. The prVis software package includes several features to support easier interpretation of visualized data, including color coding for discrete and continuous variables, alpha blending, adding row numbers to data points, and removing outliers. PrVis also provides users with options for random sampling and memory-mapping to better work with large datasets.

"Sanchez-Pla Alex";"Lheuristic-A Shiny app to select genes potentially regulated by methylation";"Methylation is a key process in cancer. Usually it acts by inhibiting the expression of the gene but if methylation is low then any values of expression, high or low, can be found. This suggests that to select genes regulated by methylation one may look for patterns in the relation between gene expression and methylation showing either an L-shape or negative correlation between expression and methylation. We have developed a heuristic algorithm that mimics the process of visually selecting an ?L-shape?, that is genes that can show a wide range of expression values (low to high) when methylation is low, but only low expressions for intermediate or high methylation. We have compared the method with naïve correlation and, despite not being able to quantify its accuracy -because no dataset with ?TRUE? L-shaped genes is available- its performance seems to be very good especially due to its flexibility. The method has been implemented in an R package, ?Lheuristic? and a Shiny application, both available from GitHub (http://github.com/alexsanchezpla). Given two matrices -expression and methylation values - with the same row and column names the program offers the possibility to select genes based on either negative correlation, the heuristic algorithm or both methods at once. Once genes have been selected, results can be interactively reviewed, plotted or downloaded.";"poster"

"Birr Stefan";"Pattern localization in electrical time series";"Using the rstudio interface to keras and tensorflow in R we constructed and trained a convolutional neural network to detect start and end time of a single device run from the consumption data of the complete household. This technique can be used in the area of non-intrusive load monitoring, to extract the consumption of single devices from the whole signal. Furthermore, it enables us to learn about the frequency and the typical time when a device is used in a household. While Deep Learning techniques require access to rather large datasets, the process of collecting this data is time and cost intensive. Also in the area of non-intrusive load monitoring the labelling is often not reliable enough. Therefore we created a large artificial dataset combining extracted pattern, created by collecting consumption pattern with smart plugs, and noise from multiple smartmeter readings. This enabled us to perform the training on a much bigger dataset than usually available. Another fascinating finding was that, although feature engineering is rather atypical when using deep learning, we were able to enhance our results significantly and were able to counter the information loss that comes with the necessary batch normalization. Additionally to our methods and models, I would also like to give some insights on the experimental iterations we went through before we arrived at our present result.  ";"poster"

"Hejblum Boris";"VICI: a Shiny app for accurate estimation of Vaccine Induced Cellular Immunogenicity with bivariate modeling";"In vaccine clinical development, it is important to assess the ability of a candidate vaccine to generate immune responses. Cellular immunogenicity is usually measured by Intra-Cellular Staining (ICS) after specific stimulation. The usual method for the analyzing such data is to i) first subtract the response observed in non-stimulated cells from each stimulated sample; ii) then perform an inter- or intra-arm comparison of the percentages of cells producing cytokine(s) of interest. Step i) aims at capturing the antigen-specific response, but the subtraction may induce biased estimates and compromise type 1 error and harm statistical power. We have proposed a bivariate regression model as a new method for an accurate estimation of the vaccine effect from ICS data in vaccine trials. This allows to model a linear relationship between the non-stimulated response and the antigenic responses, while taking into account both of their measurement errors, taking all available cellular response information into account. Our method displays good performances in terms of bias, type I error control and statistical power under various scenarios in numerical simulations. We present a user-friendly R Shiny application (relying on the nlme package) that we implemented for immunologists to be able to use our method directly, and we applied it to analyze data from two HIV vaccine trials.";"lightning talk"
"Coors Stefan";"mlr3ordinal";"Ordinal regression is a method to model targets of ordinal nature, e.g. preference values. We present a more efficient and general alternative compared to classical approaches like ordinal binary decomposition or traditional statistical thresholding models such as the cumulative link. These classical approaches are either computationally demanding - as they require fitting of multiple models - or are limited to a single, often linear model. Our model-agnostic approach casts the problem as a regression problem first, then assigns ordinal classes by optimizing multiple thresholds. This allows the use of arbitrary non-linear ML regression techniques, including ensembles or model stacks. Thresholds are determined by black-box optimizing them w.r.t. to any performance measure of choice and cross-validation to avoid overfitting. The package also includes common ordinal regression performance measures for model evaluation.  ";"poster"

This is certainly true within the R community, as evidenced by the number of packages hosted by CRAN related to this area.

The majority of packages contain approaches aimed at detecting point anomalies i.e. single observations, which are anomalous with regards to their data context. We introduce the anomaly package, which contains novel methodology aimed at detecting not only point anomalies but also collective anomalies, i.e., anomalous data segments. Importantly, the main algorithm of the package is capable of simultaneously detecting and distinguishing between both anomaly types. The utility of this approach is demonstrated on both simulated data, and real astrophysical data from NASA's Kepler telescope, which is included within the package.";"oral presentation"

"Millo Giovanni";"Common Correlated Effects Methods in R";"In the last decade, econometricians have devoted increasing attention first to the issues of nonstationarity and cointegration in pooled time series data, then to the related problem of crosssectional dependence induced by common factors. Among different approaches, Pesaran's Common Correlated Effects (CCE) augmentation has proved particularly promising both for consistent estimation and unit root testing under nonstationarity and cross-sectional strong dependence. An extension of package plm is described, comprising pooled and heterogeneous CCE estimators in both the mean groups and the generalized fixed effects (CCEP) styles. The same software framework allows for cross-sectional-correlation robust, so-called second generation unit root tests as cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) regressions; and for common-factor robust pooling tests as well. Lastly, implementing CCE estimators as OLS on transformed (here: projected) data allows for easily extending the general framework for cluster-robust and for block-bootstrapped standard errors to this class of estimators.

"Perrot-Dockes Marie";"Penalized regressions to study multivariate linear models : the VariSel package.";"We propose a new methodology to study multivariate linear models.
It consists in estimating the covariance matrix of the responses beforehand and plugging this estimator into a penalized regression model to perform variable selection.
Depending on the application field and the data at hand, different penalizations are preferred. For example, recoursing on a l1-norm penalty performs a ""simple"" selection in the regression coefficients. In certain situations, we need to select the same variable for all the responses or a group of variables all together. This can be done by means of a penalty similar to the sparse group Lasso (Yuan and Lin (2006)). Another example is the fused-Lasso penalty, where one want to influence variables to have the same coefficient (Hoefling (2010)). We study an example in genomic for study water-use efficiency (WE) of vine. The covariables are the number of replicates of the different alleles of different genes and the responses characterize the WE of the different vines. The aim is to select genes or alleles that have an effect on this WE. We consider several ways to study the problem: either by selecting an allele of a gene for a specific response or by influencing it to have the same coefficients for all the responses. It can also be interesting to select all the alleles of the same gene together. The presentation will show how to do all of this with the VariSel package.";"lightning talk"

In my talk, I will show how we can use plumber filters to secure plumber APIs. I then present the sealr package (github.com/jandix/sealr) which provides standardized strategies for authentication and authorization, namely JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (implemented), OAuth2 and general API tokens (under development at time of submission). sealr is inspired by the manifold passport.js package for Node.js. The main functionality of sealr is verifying tokens sent to plumber - how those tokens are issued by plumber is not covered (yet) as it is highly application-specific.

As with many non-profit organizations, CI has experienced resource constraints concerning information management and data analysis. In 2017, CI formed a new analytics department charged with providing data understandings and insights to various levels of the organization. Open-source and available to all constituents globally, R has been used for ad hoc analyses and provided a number of no-cost solutions in the form of functions, Shiny apps, and parameterized reports. An auto-modeler was built using xgboost to aid in predictive modeling for targeting of various marketing and fundraising campaigns. Through the deployment of an R Shiny app, the client care team was provided with a ?next-best action? and data capture tool to enhance and automate the existing spreadsheet-managed process. R Markdown parameterized reports and an R Shiny app have been created for the global programs team to assess nutritional status of children according to WHO standards. The development of these flexible and interactive tools through R has begun to facilitate a culture transition to wiser and more efficient usage of data.";"poster"
"Fabiola La Gamba";"Bayesian sequential integration within a preclinical PK/PD modeling framework using rstan package: Lessons learned";"Although Bayesian methods are expanding considerably, their applications in the field of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling is still relatively limited. In this work, Bayesian techniques are used to estimate a novel PK/PD model developed to quantify the PD synergy between two compounds using historical in vivo data. The model is fitted using package rstan, the R interface to Stan. Stan is a recently developed software package which allows an efficient estimation using the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). rstan facilitates the use of this powerful tool, allowing to run Stan models within R. Since the data consist of a series of trials performed sequentially, a Bayesian sequential integration is considered: the posteriors resulting from the analysis of one trial are used to specify the priors of the next trial. Challenges and opportunities of this technique will be discussed with respect to: (i) prior specification, (ii) random effect choice, (iii) experimental design. In addition, the results from an extensive simulation study assessing the performance of the Bayesian sequential integration for an increasing model complexity are evaluated. The results suggest that the Bayesian sequential integration is promising in certain settings. The specification of informative priors and a suitable experimental design are nevertheless advisable, especially in preclinical studies.";"lightning talk"

The goal is to find a consensus by combining all experts' knowledge. We have built an R Shiny application to automate this procedure for an international governmental organization.  The administration module allows to create a survey, invite experts and control the elicitation phase. When elicitation is completed, a report can be built automatically. This helps to find a consensus by plotting e.g. the combined distribution of all experts' elicitations. The administrator can, at any time, download the available data for use outside the Shiny application. In the elicitation module, the assigned experts can define values for the requested quantiles in a table. The corresponding distribution is shown in an interactive barplot. By dragging the breakpoints in the barplot, the provided elicitation values in the table are automatically updated and vice-versa. 
 During this talk, we will share our experiences on deployment with ShinyProxy. This allowed us to easily restrict the administration module to authorized users only and to guarantee persistent data storage using a docker volume.";"oral presentation"

Models based on Bayesian Inference has currently an increasing attention, in special more accurate results have been demonstrated. This work presents a Bayesian Model that learns from statistical data components characteristics, that improves forecasting accuracy. The application is presented to a pollution variable about air contamination, measured in Medellin city, and of course, programmed in R. Bayesian Statistics uses probability distributions to model the random variables uncertainty for data forecasting and for parameters. A distribution for parameters of the model is considered, but also, a predictive distribution is used to do the forecasting process. Parameter estimation are crucial for prediction, because they should represent a similar behavior of the data that present a seasonal behavior and correlation with their past. The Bayesian Regression Model considers these dynamic characteristics, which in this case will perform a prediction about pollution, important to politics formulation about the environment.";"poster"

Its ease of use makes it possible to produce ""quick and dirty"" applications.
However, as soon as we try to go beyond the proof-of-concept and produce applications with professional vocation, some development and deployment aspects must be taken into account.
Designing a shiny application that is maintainable over time, scalable, tested, robust and deployable is not an easy task. And like everything R-related, there are more wrong ways than right ways to do so.

With the {golem} package, we suggest a development template that relies on a R package. It contains a series of tools that allows you to add functionalities to your application for both development and deployment. For example `golem::add_module()` allows to add a Shiny module, `golem::use_favicon()` allows to add a favicon to the application. In addition, functions such as `golem::add_rconnect_file()` or `golem::gen_dockerfile()` allows you to easily deploy your application on RSconnect or shinyproxy.

The growing availability of results from large genome-wide association studies, not only for clinical outcomes but also for lifestyle exposures, makes MR analyses based on summary genetic data relevant for many exposure-outcome relationships. Properly conducting MR studies in R requires several steps that involve packages for both estimation and data visualization. We will present how to best exploit R to perform and present two-sample MR analyses with an example of our work on the role of obesity-related factors in cancer risk. The approach include the harmonization of the genetic information for the exposure and outcome, the estimation of the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome using different estimators, and a number of complementary analyses for the evaluation of potential pleiotropy, heterogeneity, assumption violations, and bias. The wide range of techniques required to conduct a robust MR analysis is reflected in the use of both largely used and MR-specific packages.";"lightning talk"
"Robin Geneviève";"R package lori: A new multiple imputation method for count data with side information";"In ecology, and particularly in species monitoring, one encounters count tables with many missing values. In these settings, multiple imputation is often used to produce complete data sets which correctly reflect the uncertainty related to the missingness. Side information in the form of covariates describing the rows (environmental sites, etc.) and columns (times stamps, species, etc.) of the table are often also available. The simultaneous analysis of covariates with the count table is useful in order to (i) improve the quality of imputation if covariates are good predictors of the counts (ii) assess the relationship between the covariates and the counts to detect factors which may be favourable or adverse to species. We introduce an R package, lori, which implements a new multiple imputation method for count data with side information, and achieves these two goals simultaneously. To generate multiple imputed data set, we rely on a resampling procedure combining nonparametric and semiparametric bootstrap, which produces several (incomplete) new data sets. Then, each data set is imputed using a Poisson log-linear model which may incorporate main effects of rows, columns and/or covariates, and row-column interactions; the model is fit with a doubly penalized maximum likelihood procedure. The package also contains functions to aggregate and visualize the multiple imputation results.";"poster"
"Audigier Vincent";"micemd: a smart multiple imputation R package for missing multilevel data";"Multiple imputation is a common strategy to overcome the missing data issue. Several MI methods have been proposed in the literature to impute multilevel data with classical sporadically missing values only. However, methods for dealing with more complex missing data are needed. Indeed, the multilevel structure is often due to data merging (because of the heterogeneity between collected datasets), but variables often vary according to the dataset, leading to systematically missing variables. micemd is an addon for the mice package to perform multiple imputation using chained equations with two-level data. It includes imputation methods specifically handling sporadically and systematically missing values (Resche-Rigon et al. 2013, Audigier, V. et al, 2018). micemd offers a complete solution for the analysis: the choice of the imputation model for each variable can be automatically tuned according to the data structure (Audigier, V. et al, 2018), it gathers tools for checking model fitting (Blackwell, M. et al, 2015) and allows parallel calculation. The talk is motivated by a meta-analysis in cardiovascular disease consisting of 28 observational cohorts in which systematically missing and sporadically missing data (GREAT data). Then, based on a simulation study, advantages and drawbacks of each multiple imputation method are discussed. Finally, methods are compared on the GREAT data.";"oral presentation"

PathwayVisualiseR implements a fit object, which is the output from a linear model that was fit for each gene for a given series of samples, from the limma R package. PathwayVisualiseR, therefore, enables the user to incorporate the results from gene set tests, such as Camera, Roast and Fry.

They are for example used to predict the genogeographic origin of individuals related to forensic crime and identification cases. A likelihood ratio test (LRT) approach is derived in order to prevent erroneous conclusions due to e.g. no relevant populations in a database of reference populations. The LRT is a measure of absolute concordance between a profile and a population, rather than a relative measure of the profile's likelihood in two populations by a likelihood ratio (LR). The LRT is similar to Fisher's exact test and constitutes an outlier test analogous to studentized residuals. Varying sample sizes of the reference populations in the database are explicitly included in the LRT with fewer assumptions than the LR. The LRT is extended to handle admixed profiles (parents of different genogeographic origin). The methodology has been implemented in the R package genogeographer with an optional shiny front-end, that enables forensic geneticists to make explorative analyses, produce various graphical outputs together with evidential weight computations.";"oral presentation"

Some studies such as Ioannidis et. el (2009) have estimated that over fifty percent of published papers in some fields of research are not reproducible. In statistical and data analysis projects, this appears to be due to lack of training and poor tools rather than scientific fraud.

In the R community, there is a move towards Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) approaches to reproducible research and reporting. Employing computing tools like GNU Make to regenerate output when syntax or data files change, GNU git for version control, writing GNU R functions or packages for repetitive tasks and R Markdown for reporting can greatly improve reproducibility.

The gnumaker package is ideal for statisticians and data analysts with little experience of Make. By specifying the relationships between syntax and data files gnumaker makes it easy to create and plot GNU Makefiles as DAGs. Gnumaker employs Make pattern rules for R, Sweave, R Markdown, Stata, SAS, etc outlined in P Baker (2019) Using GNU Make to Manage the Workflow of Data Analysis Projects, Journal of Statistical Software (Accepted).

In the early stages of drug development, different types of information on the compounds are collected: the chemical structures of the molecules, the predicted targets (target predictions), various bioassays, the toxicity and more. An analysis of each data set could reveal interesting yet disjoint information. An important task is the integration of the data sets from the experiments to understand the working mechanism of the drug. Multi-source clustering methods aim to discover groups of objects that are consistently similar across data sets. We introduce a new multi-source clustering method, M-ABC, which applies a consensus function generating a clustering of clusters. This can improve the quality of individual clustering algorithms. The proposed method is implemented and publicly available in the R package IntClust which is a wrapper package for a multitude of ensemble clustering methods. In addition, visualization for a comparison of clustering results and cluster specific secondary analyses such as differential gene expression and pathway analysis are available.";"oral presentation"

It has been extensively used to characterize taxonomic and functional profiles of many ecosystems including the human gut microbiota. In the later, the shifts in the abundancy of specific species are used as biomarkers for many biological or clinical conditions such as cancer, diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease. However a lot of technical difficulties arise when working with such data: high-dimension, noise, high sparsity, low number of replicates... Thus, detecting these shifts with satisfying precision and recall is challenging. Many statistical methods were introduced in the past decade, each trying to overcome specific constraint of the data. In this study we present a benchmark of the most commonly used methods for detecting differentially abundant features between samples. By using semi-simulated data, statistical performances such as true/false positive or negative rates are assessed.

There is a need for such valuation in the banking sector, not only for accounting purposes but also for regulations compliance. Traditionally, appraisers with expert knowledge following some common practices and standards made those valuations.

The emergence of Big Data and other breakthrough Data Science technologies has triggered a lot of new approaches using statistical tools, such as regression, tree-based methods or neural networks, among others. However, an expert algorithm approach proves to be useful and more understandable for the real estate market stakeholders. In this work, we present the implementation of an expert algorithm in R that mimic the behavior of human appraisers searching comparable properties in a curated database. The set of rules has been set after a thorough analysis in cooperation with an important appraisal company.

"Nocairi Hicham";"Stacking Prediction for a binary Outcome";"A large number of supervised classification models have been proposed in the literature. In order to avoid any bias induced by the use of one single statistical approach, they may be combined through a specific ?stacking? meta-model. To deal with the case of multiclass response, we introduce several improvements to stacking: combining models is done through partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) instead of ordinary (OLS) due to the strong correlation between predictions, and a specific methodology is developed for the case of a small number of observations, using repeated sub-sampling for variable selection. Five very different models (Bagging, Naive Bayes, Support vector machine (SVM), Sparse PLS-DA, Weighted k-Nearest-Neighbor) are combined through this improved stacking, and applied in the following context: according to the 7th Amendment of the European Cosmetic Directive, L'Oréal is committed to stop animal testing. Consequently, l'Oréal must develop alternative approaches for safety evaluation of chemicals. Stacking methodology is applied to the prediction of potential sensitization of chemicals, based upon in vitro and in silico characteristics in order to predict a two groups.

Larger companies, universities or governmental organizations can afford professional data scientists, but what about civil society or NPOs? Currently, the resources to generate and use data science insights are highly imbalanced. Using R, we show how to leverage this unused potential by applying a cutting-edge multi-language classification approach.

We use NLP techniques such as multi-language word embeddings (word2vec), unsupervised classification (e1071, caret) and topic modeling (stm) to enable Minor volunteers to better allocate their time. We demonstrate the implementation of an interactive Shiny Dashboard app for classifying and filtering multilingual Facebook comments, including English, Bulgarian and Arabic. The filter mechanisms first identify and filter out comments in the Facebook groups which Minor monitors. The topic model then allocates comments to the respective volunteer at Minor.

Safe option was to build a high availability, load balanced environment, though it is not future proof as users keep on increasing and computing resources need to be optimized accordingly. We decided to take a two-pronged approach, where a kubernetes backed containerized solution will be the primary interface and a load balanced product for backing up additional load. Users launch their own containers and kubernetes takes care of backend resource allocations. They can run both Jupyter notebooks (through jupyterhub) and R scripts (through RStudio Server Pro) in the container and perform multiple assignments concurrently.";"poster"
"Binois Mickael";"The GPareto and GPGame packages for multi and many objective Bayesian optimization";"The GPareto package provides multi-objective optimization algorithms for expensive black-box functions and an ensemble of dedicated uncertainty quantification methods. Popular methods such as efficient global optimization in the mono-objective case rely on Gaussian processes or Kriging to build surrogate models. Several infill criteria have also been proposed in a multi-objective setup to select new points sequentially and efficiently cope with severely limited evaluation budgets. They are implemented, in addition to Pareto front estimation and uncertainty quantification visualization in the design and objective spaces. Rather than estimating the entire Pareto front, the GPGame package focus on finding equilibrium solutions (e.g., Nash equilibrium) that are better suited for larger number of objectives.";"lightning talk"
"Olteanu Madalina";"Focal distances and distortion coefficients: assessing the individual perception of multiscalar segregation";"The complexity of urban segregation continues to challenge interdisciplinary research, and these last years even more so, with more fine-grained massive data becoming available. We have recently introduced a general method for assessing how inequalities are individually perceived, from any location in the city. By building trajectories which measure each how different the image an individual has in an ever expanding neighbourhood around her location, from that of the whole city, we obtain a multiscalar fingerprint of segregation. Furthermore, we summarize these trajectories by features called focal distances and distortion coefficients. With these, one may easily characterize how distorted the image of the city one has in a given location is, and which is the distance one has to walk from her house to get a correct image of what the city really looks like, similarly to zooming with a camera lens. Detailed maps of segregation may then be drawn, and hotspots of segregation thus isolated. We applied this method on various datasets (social housing distribution in Paris, migrant integration in European capitals, ...), with promising results and new insights on the segregation phenomenon. We illustrate the method and some results with an intuitive R implementation, mainly oriented towards visualisation, and aimed essentially to be used by social scientists for spatial data exploration. ";"poster"

The new mlr3 package is its modular, from-scratch reimplementation in R6. Data is stored primarily as data.tables. mlr3 relies heavily on the reference semantics of R6 and data.table, which enable efficient and elegant programming on the provided machine learning building blocks. The package is geared towards scalability and larger datasets by natively supporting parallelization and out-of-memory data-backends like databases. With a clear object-oriented design, mlr3 focuses on core computational operations, while add-on packages allow seamless integration of extended functionality. For example, mlr3survival implements tasks and learners for survival analysis, and mlr3pipelines extends mlr3 with graphs of (pre)-processing operations, which can be jointly tuned with the mlr3tuning package.

"Ledell Erin";"Building and Benchmarking Automatic Machine Learning Systems";"This talk will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML), with a focus on software and benchmarking. The term ""AutoML"" refers to automated methods for model selection and/or hyperparameter optimization and includes such techniques as automated stacking (ensembles), neural architecture search, pipeline optimization and feature engineering. AutoML tools are designed to maximize ease-of-use by simplifying the API. We will discuss the common AutoML software design patterns and take a detailed look at the AutoML algorithm inside of the ""h2o"" R package.

An important part of the development process to evolve and improve an AutoML system is a comprehensive benchmarking strategy. Benchmarking AutoML software across a wide variety of datasets allows the algorithm designer to identify weaknesses in the algorithm and software. This enables tool designers to make incremental, measurable improvements to their system over time. We will present a new open source platform for benchmarking AutoML systems which is part of the OpenML.org ecosystem for reproducible research in machine learning. The system is extensible, so anyone can write a wrapper for their software in order to benchmark it against the most popular open source AutoML systems. We will also present benchmarking results for H2O AutoML against a variety of (mostly Python-based) AutoML systems.";"oral presentation"

It has over 8000 questions on StackOverflow, is frequently a featured package and one of the most downloaded packages (https://www.r-pkg.org), has over 60 contributors (https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/graphs/contributors) and is active in development for over 10 years. Over the last couple of years, several new functionalities and improvements, including parallelisation of several operations, have been made including file reading (`fread`), file writing (`fwrite`), subset operations, automatic secondary indexing, ordering, non equi joins, overlapping joins, rolling functionalities etc. In this talk, all such improvements will be summarised showcasing different tasks of varying complexity that can be tackled using data.table with ease and with little code. The intuition behind the syntax of data.table will also be explained. Finally, a quick benchmark of some common tasks will be highlighted to clearly show the performance of data.table.

I present a new package ""odin"" for removing this tradeoff by creating a domain specific language (DSL) hosted in R that compiles a subset of R to C for efficiently expressing and solving differential equations (JavaScript and R are compilation targets under current development). By treating the set of differential equations as a directed acyclic graph, the DSL is declarative rather than imperative. ""odin"" leverages the well established ""deSolve"" package to interface with a number of well understood solvers. I present applications of ""odin"" both in a research context for implementing epidemiological models with 10's of thousands of equations and in teaching contexts where we are using the introspection built into the DSL to automatically generate shiny interfaces.";"oral presentation"

Tools and methods are needed to facilitate the annotation and the integration such codes to decipher and compare care trajectories. Because medical data are often codified according to international nomenclatures, they can be linked to knowledge representations from medical and pharmacological domains. Linked Data initiatives and Semantic Web technologies have led to the spread of knowledge representations through ontologies, thesauri, taxonomies and nomenclatures. However, the use of these standards, technologies and knowledge representations is still hesitant for non-computer scientists as non-trivial to organize and query for pharmaco-epidemiologist researchers.The R package queryMed (https://github.com/yannrivault/queryMed) provides user-friendly methods to access biomedical knowledge resources from the Linked Data.

It is a promising tool to detect practically usable biomarkers. However, its interpretation can be hard to make, because metabolites present from the spectrum of a complex mixture are often identified and quantified only from expert knowledge. To facilitate the use of such data, we developed a new R package, ASICS, that implements a method for the automatic identification and quantification of metabolites in 1H NMR spectra. The package combines all the steps of the analysis (management of a reference library, preprocessing, quantification, diagnosis tools to assess the quality of the quantification, post-quantification statistical analyses). 
To assess the performance of ASICS, both the quantification and its impact on a post-quantification differential analysis were evaluated. Correlations between ASICS relative quantifications and biochemical dosages were computed and a similar analysis was performed with other quantification methods.
These comparisons showed that ASICS allows for a faster and simpler direct biological interpretation than the classical bucket approach and obtains more precisely identified and quantified metabolites than other quantification methods. ASICS is released as an R/Bioconductor package.";"poster"

It's a common test used to detect heart problems and monitor the heart's status. An ECG is a non-invasive, painless test with quick results. Thanks to the technological advances of the 21st century, there are portable medical devices for recording and storage of the ECGs, thereby facilitate study of these. Generally, studies use mathematical and statistics methodologies, which lead to the reduction, identification, and extraction of information. These can contribute significantly to the analysis and decision making by medical personnel. An interactive application was made using Rstudio and its Shiny library, which uses an Arduino microcontroller (Leonardo) to read, store and graph the data from the electrical activity of the examined patient. The App through signal processing tools identifies and illustrates persistent features, commonly associated with the components of the cycles, such as the P wave, the QRS complex and the T wave, these features are useful to analyze times and electrical intensities resulting from the measurement. Therefore, the App reads, stores, graphs and identifies characteristics of the ECG that contribute to the enhancement in the analysis and the decision making by medical personnel.";"lightning talk"

Ultimately, can we use the DNA to predict if a consumer might say ?this apple is tasty? or ?I like the beneficial health effects?? To tackle this daunting problem of linking a plant's DNA to a consumer's spoken word, we need to know everything about the plant, the consumer, and all the steps in between.

"Bhatnagar Sahir";"A flexible approach to time-to-event data analysis using case-base sampling";"In epidemiological studies of time-to-event data, a quantity of interest to the clinician and the patient is the absolute risk of an event given a covariate profile. However, time matching or risk set sampling (including Cox partial likelihood) eliminates the baseline hazard from the likelihood expression for the hazard ratios. This has to be recovered using a non-parametric method which leads to step-wise estimates of the cumulative incidence that are difficult to interpret. The analysis can be further complicated in the presence of competing events. Using case-base sampling, we explain how a single event type or competing risk analysis that directly models the hazard function parametrically can be performed using logistic or multinomial regression. This formulation thus allows us to leverage all the machinery developed for GLMs including goodness-of-fit tests and variable selection. Furthermore, because we are explicitly modeling time, we obtain smooth estimates of the cumulative incidence that are easy to interpret. We demonstrate our approach using data from patients who received stem-cell transplant for acute leukemia. We provide our method in the casebase R package published on CRAN with extensive documentation and examples.";"oral presentation"

Existing implementations of time series models work well in isolation, however it has long-been known that ensembles of forecasts improve forecast accuracy. Hybrid forecasting (separately forecasting components of a time series) is another useful forecasting method. Both ensemble and hybrid forecasts can be expressed as forecast combinations. Recent enhancements to the fable framework now provide a flexible approach to easily combine and evaluate the forecasts from multiple models. The fable package is designed for extensibility, allowing for easier creation of new forecasting models and tools. Without any further implementation, extension models can leverage essential functionality including plotting, accuracy evaluation, model combination and diagnostics.

"Kumar Rajeev Ranjan";"Extreme learning machine model for forecasting drought index";"Drought is a complex hydrologic feature of arid and semiarid regions with strong implications on the sustainability of water resources, agriculture and environmental management. A drought forecasting model is a practical tool for drought-risk management. Drought models are used to forecast drought indices (DIs) that quantify drought by its onset, termination, and subsequent properties such as the severity, duration, and peak intensity in order to monitor and evaluate the impacts of future drought. Some of the well-known indices used in drought studies, monitoring and management are: Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Effective Drought Index (EDI), Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI), etc. In this study, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Effective Drought Index (EDI) are used for the forecasting of drought. An effort have been made to develop R code for converting the weather variable data in to Effective Drought Index. By using the developed R code, precipitation data are converted in to Effective Drought Index. Forecasting of drought index have been performed by using extreme learning machine (ELM). Different performance measure like MAPE, MSE, RMSE etc. are used for evaluation of the performance. The result indicated that ELM based model perform better compare to the ARIMA and ANN models.";"poster"

The downsides of a high flexibility are that (i) ABM must be defined algorithmically (requiring programming) and (ii) ABM are black-box models, the study of which resort to large numbers of simulations. The GAMA modeling platform offers a user-friendly language (GAML) and environment to develop and efficiently run ABM, potentially in an explicit spatial environment. It lacks, however, the statistical tools to exploit ABM simulations. The rama package is an R interface to GAMA intended to fill this gap. The package defines the S3 class experiment that inherits from the tbl_df class and that is tidyverse compatible. An experiment object is linked to an ABM model defined in a GAML (text) file and contains, for this model, a number of simulations (in rows) that differ by their seed and/or parameters values (in columns). Methods are available to intuitively subset and combine experiment objects, as well as to generate experimental designs for experiment objects. Among them, run_experiment() seamlessly calls the GAMA engine to run the simulations of an experiment object and returns it augmented with a list-column of data frames of time series of the simulations outputs. Simulations outputs can then be analysed in R for model calibration, sensitivity analysis and hypotheses testing.";"lightning talk"

Despite the large number of packages available, there are some anomaly detection challenges that are not supported with existing packages. We reduce this gap by introducing three new R packages for anomaly detection, `oddstream`, `oddwater` and `stray`, with special reference to their capabilities, competitive features and target applications. Package `oddstream` introduces a framework that provides early detection of anomalous behaviours within a large collection of streaming time series. This includes a novel approach that adapts to non-stationarity in the time series.

Starting from multiclass diagonal discriminant analysis classifiers which avoid the problem of high dimensional covariance estimation we construct a hybrid model that seamlessly integrates feature selection components. We compare our method with several other statistical machine learning packages in R, showing marked improvements in regard to prediction accuracy, interpretability of chosen features, and fast run time. We then introduce genDA (in active development), a DA method capable for use in multi-distributional response data - generalising the capabilities of DA beyond Gaussian response.

While it is crucial that medical students understand the corresponding regulatory mechanisms and their interactions, conveying these in a frontal lecture with hard time constraints is rather challenging. We present two web applications for the teaching and exploration of Ca-Pi homeostasis, building upon on a previously published mathematical model. To ensure efficient computations, the model was first translated to C. In parallel, we developed novel user-interfaces with the web-framework R-Shiny, embedding the compiled model outputs in highly coupled modules. The first application explores the fundamentals of Ca-Pi homeostasis, while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic, thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding of Ca-Pi regulation. These applications are hosted on RStudio Connect at http://physiol-seafile.uzh.ch.  In conclusion, we showed that R, C and Shiny can be coupled to emulate a real-life environment, thereby providing a promising starting point for future innovative teaching approaches. This project was a unique opportunity to extend the RShiny framework with shinydashboardPlus and bs4Dash.";"poster"

They are used in a lot of domains, specifically when measurements are collected from persons by observations, testings, or questionnaires. ordinalClust is an R package that proposes efficient tools for modeling, clustering, co-clustering, and classification for ordinal data. The data are modeled through the BOS distribution, a gaussian-like distribution parameterized with a position and a precision parameter. On one hand, the co-clustering framework uses the Latent Block Model (LBM) and an SEM-Gibbs algorithm for the parameters inference. On the other hand, the clustering and the classification methods follow on from simplified versions of this algorithm. ";"oral presentation"
"Sontrop Herman";"Creating beautiful Shiny apps with Vue, Vuetify and D3";"Shiny is a great platform for making interactive web applications. Most shiny apps are based on the standard Bootstrap 3 theme. Because of this, most apps look very similar. By now though Bootstrap 3 is quite old and new, more powerful frameworks and design philosophies have emerged, such as Material Design by Google. Vue is one of the hottest, most popular of these newer web frameworks. Vue is an incrementally adoptable UI framework that makes it possible to compose your UI via a set of small web components. Vue also makes it quite easy to create your own set of components, from which other, bigger components can be created, much like Shiny modules. One of the reasons Vue is so popular is that it's also quite easy to learn. Fortunately, it's also quite simple to empower Shiny applications with Vue! A popular Vue implementation of Material Design is Vuetify, a UI component framework with over 80 web components. In this talk we show what Vue and Vuetify are and how they can be combined with Shiny to create awesome looking frontends. We also show several examples of how interactive Vue components can be created using the power of d3.js, a popular visualization library and show how these components can work together. Last, we present a showcase that combines the above libraries in an interactive network viewer, using data from Elastic Search and the neo4j Graph engine, all controlled directly from R!";"oral presentation"
"Moritz Steffen";"Experiences from dealing with missing values in sensor time series data";"Sensors are omnipresent in our modern world. From manufacturing industry, finance, up to biology in nearly every domain sensors provide us with essential information. Although everybody seems to be well-equipped with sensors, operating these can be error prone. Especially missing values are a problem often encountered. Since follow-up analysis and processes often require complete data, missing data replacement ('imputation') is needed as a preprocessing step. In this talk we will give insights about our experiences on handling missing data in several industry related projects. We will also give a short introduction to the imputeTS package, which we developed as a result of these experiences.  Imputation itself is a well-established area in statistical surveys and CRAN offers a surprisingly large choice of packages (i.a. 'mice', 'missMDA', 'Amelia'). However, there are differences between imputation for statistical surveys and sensor time series. We will discuss typical problems arising with missing data imputation in sensor time series and also present for which kind of data / missing data patterns / missing data mechanisms imputation proved to be successful. Overall, this talk is supposed to provide a first glance at sensor data imputation in R along with giving an introduction to the imputeTS package.";"oral presentation"

Unlike a conventional spatial statistics or analysis course, the workshop integrated learning to code in R with learning to think spatially. Researchers learned how to explore, manipulate, and visualize spatial data using recently-developed spatial packages in R, while at the same time learning habits for project management and reproducible research. This talk discusses pitfalls and success stories from the workshop, along with considerations when putting together a spatial data curriculum in R. It describes how teaching researchers led to increased programming literacy among researchers, as well as contributions to open source spatial packages. Finally, it puts forth suggestions for a spatial data curriculum that can be shared openly to teach spatial thinking in R worldwide.";"lightning talk"

As a consequence, simple questions such as ""How many votes did women have to the house of representatives?"" can take hours of programming to answer. This means lesser transparency on elections. CEPESPData (cepesp.io) was developed by the Center of Politics and Economics of the Public Sector at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (CEPESP-FGV) with support from the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and the Brazilian Electoral Supreme Court (TSE) to handle this problem. All databases found in CepespData were originally made available by the TSE. In order to assure data integrity, all procedures to clean and process the data are registered on GitHub (available at https://github.com/Cepesp-Fgv).

Some tools even allow to follow a sample over time. Image processing techniques can extract many information from the images about biological objects (number, location in 2D or 3D space and time, biological status, shape...). Analysis of such biological data is facing to two main challenges: the need to take into account the spatial and temporal context of each piece of information, and the need to gather and compare many images pre-processed with multiple softwares from many samples.

Given the breadth of techniques and the state-of-the-art algorithms available within the R ecosystem, a significant fraction of our data scientists, prefer R as their lingua franca, necessitating the need to provide first-class infrastructure support in R.

The underlying idea can be extended to many other robust techniques like S- and MM-estimates. Through this approach, monitoring of robust estimates computed over a range of key parameter values, which is a technique advocated in a number of recent articles, the diagnostic tools of choice can be tuned in such a way that highly robust estimators which are as efficient as possible are obtained. These tools are available already for quite some time in the MATLAB FSDA (Flexible Statistics for Data Analysis) toolbox which has evolved into a comprehensive software package for robust statistics. Now the functionality of FSDA is made available for R users through the CRAN package ?fsdaR' which implements an R interface to a MATLAB engine running in the background. Such a technical solution is made possible by the MATLAB Runtime which allows running compiled MATLAB applications on computers that do not have MATLAB installed. A serious challenge is the design and implementation of the interface (the function calls) in a way acceptable for an R user. To illustrate the monitoring of robust estimates for multivariate analysis we start with a simple example and then analyze a real life data set presenting the technological structure of manufactured exports.";"lightning talk"

FastR is part of the multilingual virtual machine (GraalVM) that, among other things, provides language agnostic support for interactive debugging. One of the other projects built on top of GraalVM is a C/C++ interpreter. FastR can be configured to run the native code of selected R packages using this C/C++ interpreter, which should yield the same behavior, but since both languages are now running in one system, it opens up many exciting possibilities including seamless cross-language debugging. In the talk, we will demonstrate how to configure Visual Studio Code and FastR for cross-language interactive debugging and how to debug a sample R package with native code.";"oral presentation"
"Hocking Toby";"Fast and Optimal Peak Detection in Large Genomic Data via the PeakSegDisk Package";"We describe a new algorithm and R package for peak detection in genomic data sets using constrained optimal changepoint algorithms. These detect changes from background to peak regions by imposing the constraint that the mean should alternately increase then decrease. An existing algorithm for this problem exists, and gives state-of-the-art accuracy results, but it is computationally expensive when the number of changes is large. We propose an algorithm with empirical O(N log N) time complexity that jointly estimates the number of peaks and their locations by globally minimizing a non-convex penalized cost function. We also propose a sequential search algorithm that finds the best solution with K segments in O(N log(N) log(K)) time, which is much faster than the previous O(K N log N) algorithm. Our empirical results show that our disk-based implementation in the PeakSegDisk R package can be used to quickly compute constrained optimal models with many changepoints, which are needed to analyze typical genomic data sets that have tens of millions of observations. ";"oral presentation"

Data analysis teaching was integrated to a field biology project, in which the students collected and analyzed an empirical data set, and wrote a short report on their findings. The main method used for data analysis was linear regression modeling. A guest lecturer with a data analyst background was responsible for teaching data analysis and the use of R during the course.
 
 The first course day was dedicated to learning basics of data analysis and R. Students were eager to learn R, but reported having found this 8-hour day too intensive. On next day, the students collected an empirical data set on tree height and environmental factors potentially affecting it. They analyzed the collected data in small groups at their own pace over the next few days, and showed motivation towards analyzing their own data. Everybody managed to do the analysis and reporting tasks required for completing the project course. Some students even continued learning independently more advanced data analysis methods afterwards, winning a local science fair competition with a random forest model for tree height.";"poster"

A computational analysis of the dynamics of R style based on 94 million lines of code from all CRAN packages in the past 20 years";"The coexistence of multiple programming styles confuses new users and makes enforcing best practice difficult. This problem is aggravated by the lack of a universally accepted style guide in the R community. To investigate that, we quantified the programming style variation (PSV) in all CRAN packages and observed an emerging consensus in style since 2016, as indicated by the dampened increasing trend in PSV. It seems that a new consensus-based best practice is forming, which is a mixture of various R style guides. Concretely, we summarized the ?ins & outs? of different styles based on popularity across years (e.g., rapid rise of underscore_fun_name and fall of dotted.fun.name since 2013) and pointed out the least agreed style elements (e.g., -> v.s. =, space after a comma). Moreover, we identified a source of PSV (the ?Naughty, Naughty!?) by looking into the style differences between clusters of related packages (e.g., Finance v.s. Biostatistics). Our analysis raises an open question to all stakeholders of the R community, i.e., the R Foundation, opinion leaders, package developers, and ordinary users: should we adopt an official R style guide as in the case of Python's PEP8? The findings from this study validate the R community's effort in reducing PSV and suggest future directions.";"poster"

By elegantly utilizing Shiny's reactive structure, we break down app development into a simple workflow with three parts: user interface development, server computation, and server output.

An adaptive version of the penalty is also considered. Simulation studies show that the proposal is quite effective in grouping the response categories, thus leading to a more parsimonious model. A remarkable advantage of the procedure is the reduction of both bias and root mean square error in small samples, while no difference is observed in large samples.

"Rubak Ege";"Resample-smoothing of Voronoi intensity estimators";"Voronoi estimators are non-parametric and adaptive estimators of the intensity of a point process. The intensity estimate at a given location is equal to the reciprocal of the size of the Voronoi/Dirichlet cell containing that location. Their major drawback is that they tend to paradoxically under-smooth the data in regions where the point density of the observed point pattern is high, and over-smooth where the point density is low. To remedy this behaviour, we propose to apply an additional smoothing operation to the Voronoi estimator, based on resampling the point pattern by independent random thinning. Through a simulation study we show that our resample-smoothing technique improves the estimation substantially. The proposed intensity estimation scheme is also applied to two datasets: locations of pine saplings (planar point pattern) and motor vehicle traffic accidents (linear network point pattern). Everything is implemented in R and released in the `spatstat` package available on CRAN. The oral presentation will explain the basic concepts, which are very simple, and leave out the mathematical details. Instead, focus is on the relevant objects and classes in the R implementation and how e.g. the Voronoi/Dirichlet tesselation is handled on a linear network such as a road map.";"oral presentation"

The goodpractice package leverages several R packages addressing these aspects and, in one place, calculates code coverage (via covr) and cyclomatic complexity (via cyclocomp), runs linters (via lintr), includes all checks from R CMD check (via rcmdcheck) and gives further advice on good practices for R packages, e.g., to include a URL for a bug tracker. The package currently contains 230 checks to help package developers write high quality packages to a common standard. It is both configurable and extensible, so you can use it with your custom set of checks.

These knowledge resources are then essential for interpreting the functional activity of genes, even though, managing the large number of annotation terms associated to a gene set level is a difficult task. To address this issue, we introduce rGSAn, a R package dedicated to the Gene Set Annotation. By adopting a strategy combining semantic similarity measures, and data mining approaches, rGSAn is able to perform an unified and synthetic annotation for a gene set of interest.To do so, the best partition of the annotation terms is computed using semantic similarity measures. Then, the most relevant terms are identified using a decision tree algorithm and an heuristic implementation of the general set cover problem. In addition, rGSAn offers new visualization facilities to interactively explore the annotation results according to the hierarchical structure of Gene Ontology.";"lightning talk"
"Constantinescu Caterina";"Adjusting reviewer scores for a fairer assessment via multi-faceted Rasch modelling";"Selecting submissions for a conference can be viewed as a measurement problem: in principle, organisers aim to accept the ?best' submissions, but the precise manner in which this is achieved can vary considerably. It is also common to involve multiple reviewers in the process, and it may not always be the case that all reviewers manage to rate all submissions. Hence, there is a chance that some particularly harsh reviewers may rate the same submission (and put it at a disadvantage), or some more lenient reviewers may happen to rate the same submission and propel it higher in the ranking. A solution to this issue is offered by multi-faceted Rasch models, which view submission scores as a function of not just the quality of the submission in itself, but also reviewer severity. This allows to adjust submission scores accordingly, providing a fairer measurement process. Conveniently, the R package `TAM` allows to estimate this type of model. In this talk, I will walk you through an example of how `TAM` was used on data collected as part of the review process for a data science conference in Scotland.";"lightning talk"

It stipulates that a stable clustering reveals the true structure of the data and thus, the number of groups, k, can be selected as the one giving the most stable clustering. Several variants of cluster stability have been developed of which most are based on the same principle: 1) create a large number of sub-datasets from the original dataset, for example by subsambling observations or variables, 2) cluster each obtained sub-dataset into k distinct clusters and 3) apply a measure of cluster comparison from which the average cluster stability is computed. However, cluster stability is based on heuristics, is parameter dependent and do not always allow to select the true number of groups. We therefore propose with the clusteRstab package, a global clustering stability algorithm for which the user can specify and test different clustering algorithms, similarity measures and methods to create sub-datasets. By doing so, the user will be able to get a more global picture of the datasets' structure, and thus be less parameter dependent when selecting k.";"lightning talk"

Metadata plays a key role to make this data findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable, and becomes a pillar through legal frames (eg INSPIRE) or with the emergence of data management plans (DMPs). Data managers have thus to deal with these requirements by applying standards to manage (meta)data formats and access protocols. It is especially the case for spatial information which is ruled by ISO/OGC standards. The use of R has been spreading worldwide as preferred tool for data managers and scientists. In this context, some projects were initiated to support metadata handling for specific domains (eg EML), while the capacity to produce standardized ISO/OGC geographic metadata with R was limited. The geometa and ows4R packages aim to fill this gap by providing functions to write and read ISO/OGC metadata, and interfaces to the OGC Web Services. We explain their functioning, including recent features provided with the support of the R Consortium. We present then how they contribute to several national and international information systems in different domains such as fisheries, marine monitoring, ecology and earth observation. Based on these packages, the geoflow initiative as orchestrator for spatial data management in R will be introduced to demonstrate how R can be used for managing spatial data infrastructures.";"oral presentation"
"Lujan Criscely";"An S3 approach to the analysis of computer simulations: an illustration with the marine ecosystem model OSMOSE";"Computer simulations are programs that numerically solve a model of a system or a process. The use of simulation tools is widely extended around science. Particularly,
computers simulations and mathematical models with different levels of complexity and sophistication have been developed by ecologists. With the increasing number of R users, there are many packages already implemented to analyze computer simulations in ecology (from running the model to the analysis of model outputs). The aim of this work is to present four limitations of the packages currently developed for the analysis of computer simulations in ecology: i) inclusion of too many functions, with ii) non-standard R naming conventions, to produce iii) non-customizable plots, which are iv) produced as side effects of long calculations. We propose how to make use of the S3 object-oriented approach to analyze computer simulations and avoid these problems, by providing an illustrative example using the marine ecosystem model OSMOSE and its associated R package osmose (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=osmose). We also provide a reflection for R programmers, software developers and scientists in general; aiming to improve future development of packages and tools in ecology.";"poster"

While citation behavior is heavily studied, the debate on how to measure the value of software is still ongoing. Evidence suggests software are rarely cited in publications. There are often no standard rules among authors on how to acknowledge software. However, there are several attempts to construct standard metadata scheme for citations to software, exemplifying the stronger need for rewarding this form of scholarly output. We study how three groups of R packages are cited in scientific publications: 500 most downloaded on CRAN, Specialized packages in CRAN task views and Multi-disciplinary packages used by diverse population of scientists (e.g., statnet, igraph, lme4, nlme and bibliometrix). We query Scopus database and present empirical results of the disciplinary differences in citation behavior when it comes to multi-disciplinary packages (e.g., humanities, social sciences versus statistics and hard sciences). We control whether a publication introducing the package in the Journal of Statistical Software (from 1996 to 2018 including 948 publications) has significant effect on citation rates. We compare also citations with downloads on CRAN as a proxy of package usage and present a network analysis of R packages' position in the CRAN dependency network.

"Gonzalez-Arteaga Teresa";"An R package to deal with generalizations of weighted means and OWA operators.";"Weighted means and the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators are two families of functions defined through weighting vectors, which are widely used in the field of aggregation operators. Due to their importance, several procedures have appeared in the literature with the aim of generalizing simultaneously both families of functions. Given that weighted means and OWA operators are specific cases of the Choquet integral, the approach followed by most authors is to construct a capacity parametrized by two weighting vectors (one for the weighted mean part and the other for the OWA operator part) so that we can recover the capacity associated with the weighted mean (the OWA operator) when the weighting vector associated with the OWA operator (the weighted mean) has a neutral behavior; that is, is that of the arithmetic mean. In this research we develop an R package called WEMOWA which can compute capacities associated with two families of Choquet integrals that generalize weighted means and OWA operators: SUOWA and Semi-SUOWA operators.";"poster"
"Omerovic Sanela";"flexmixNL: an R package for mixtures of Generalized Nonlinear Models";"Finite mixture models provide a natural statistical framework for dealing with heterogeneity in data. In this context, heterogeneous patterns are attributed to latent classes which yield to the assignment of the data to distinct components under a probability-based clustering method. Generalized Nonlinear Models (GNMs) comprise nonlinear regression in a flexible way by embedding the classical nonlinear regression model within the exponential family distribution. Mixtures of GNMs represent a natural advancement in order to detect distinct components along nonlinear mean functions under flexible distributional assumptions. We introduce the flexmixNL package which performs an efficient fitting framework for mixtures of GNMs in R. The technical implementation of mixtures of GNMs builds on the modular framework of the package flexmix which was developed by Friedrich Leisch and Bettina Grün. We show applications to real world data where mixtures of GNMs prove as an appropriate model class as they face the problem of occurring heterogeneity within typical nonlinear patterns.";"poster"

In this context, modelling and simulating survival data is crucial to obtain a high precision in event time predictions during interim stages of a trial. Bayesian inference and decision making can be very expensive computationally. A great number Monte Carlo samples (posterior draws) are needed to make precise and relevant predictions.

The DRY concept -- don't repeat yourself -- is well accepted as a best practice for code and it's an equally effective way to approach your development workflow. The usethis package offers functions that enact key steps of the package development process in a programmatic and documented way. This is an attractive alternative to doing everything by hand or, more realistically, copying and modifying files from one of your other packages. Usethis helps with initial setup and also with the sequential addition of features, such as specific dependencies (e.g. Rcpp, the pipe, the tidy eval toolkit) or practices (e.g. version control, testing, continuous integration).";"oral presentation"

The R package: 'patientProfilesVis' automates the creation of such patient profile visualization. A modular approach enables the creation of four different types of visualization: 'line module' for continuous variables (e.g. laboratory measurements), 'interval module' for variables with start/end time point (e.g. treatment exposure, adverse events), 'event module' for fixed time point event (e.g. consecutive laboratory measurements) and 'text module' to display subject-specific information (e.g. demographics, medical history of the patient). For a study in-hand, visualization (plotting object) of each topic of interest can be created via a dedicated plotting function, available for each module type.
The plots are combined across modules by patient and exported into a patient profile report (pdf format), via automated Sweave reports. A Shiny application automates the creation of standard subject profile reports, to leverage the applicability for non-expert R user, as clinicians. The creation of subject profile plotting modules and report and its applicability is demonstrated with a real-life dataset from the PhUSE Working Group.";"poster"

Traditionally LVM are estimated by maximum likelihood (ML) and statistical inference is performed using Wald tests. Software such as the R package lava can be used to carry out such analysis. When dealing with regional brain data, one faces several challenges: (i) small samples, (ii) multiple comparisons, and (iii) complicated correlation structures. We present an extension to the lava package called lavaSearch2 implementing (i) corrected Wald tests that better control the type 1 error ? similar to the Kenward-Roger correction in mixed models, (ii) a Dunnett adjustment to efficiently handle multiple comparisons, and (iii) a function that automatically detect and correct model misspecifications identified based on the observed data. We illustrate the use of lavaSearch2 on regional SPECT data where we aim at quantifying the neuroinflammatory response to mild traumatic brain injury.

The objective of this paper is to develop a descriptive and predictive analysis for the concentration of the PM 2.5 pollutant in the Aburrá Valley through meteorological and temporal variables. Daily data were extracted from 5 monitoring stations of the Early Warning System of Aburrá Valley (SIATA), and models such as random forests and GAMLSS models were developed, in which it was found that variables such as month, hour, type of station, zone of the station, air temperature, wind speed, wind direction and liquid precipitation influence significantly the concentration of PM 2.5.

The PPtree classifier finds separations between classes on linear combinations of variables by optimizing a projection pursuit index. One of its drawbacks is that a rigid tree structure is generated, the depth of a PPtree object is at most G-1 (where G is the number of classes) with each class forming a single terminal node.
The modifications described here improve the predictive performance in multi-class problems, and in the presence of outliers or asymmetries.
The goal is to make the classifier more flexible, to tackle more complex problems, while maintaining interpretability.

In ecological risk assessment, the purpose can be different: in order to describe the impact of a contaminant on the response of an organism/community, bioassays are performed with a gradient of exposure concentrations to finally derive an effect concentration (e.g. a benchmark dose) from the concentration-response curve. An efficient use of such data for risk assessment requires the development of specific workflows and of turnkey tools, that should take into account monotonic and non monotonic curves and dose-response designs favoring a great number of tested doses rather than a great number of replicates. In this context we started the development of an R package and a shiny application both named DRomics (already available online in its first version https://lbbe.univ-lyon1.fr/-DRomics-.html) to help ecotoxicologists to automatically select the significant responsive molecular items, model them, derive a benchmark dose for each, classify the responses, and render results in a form usable for ecological risk assessment.

There are several well-known methods for combining p-values which can also be performed in R, for example with metap package. An important issue with the methods for combining p-values is that they assume independence among the p-values to be combined which is known to be violated in some contexts such as genome-wide association studies. Several modifications to current methods have been proposed to generalize them to account for dependence and some of these methods have already been implemented into R with packages like EmpiricalBrownsMethod and CombinePValue. However, these methods, and thus their implementations, address only a portion of the possible problems (e.g., use of only one-sided p-values or only positive correlations) which may even lead to misuse of these methods. In this study, we present the methods for combining independent and dependent p-values and their available R implementations. Then, we outline the points where these tools can be modified and extended to address common problems thoroughly for which we propose our solutions. Finally, we introduce a novel R package, poolR, where we implement our solutions to address the most if not all dependence structures.";"poster"

However, various factors such as the number of household members, respondent's educational level, and distances between houses lead to workload inequity in the completion time. This situation is similar to the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) where consumers, vehicles, and depots are analog to respondents, enumerators, and residences. Our goal is to optimize the variance of completion time between enumerators and minimize the total distance traveled. We introduce EnumeRouteR, a Shiny Application that calculates and visualizes the best enumeration routes in the form of a map by utilizing R and Leaflet. R is used to built MDVRP solver and find the best path by executing several iterations of the greedy algorithm. The solver will output the most optimal locations sequence to visit in census and survey.

"Claeys Emmanuelle";"Dynamic allocation optimization in A/B tests using classification-based preprocessing";"In traditional A/B testing, for instance on two treatments A and B, the objective of the user is to decide which of these two treatments is the best. In order to do that, a randomized test can be used in which each treatment is alternatively chosen and applied to incoming patients for a given time. However, one problem with this approach is the non-adaptivity of the test. For example, if one treatment quickly appears as having a very stronger positive or negative impact than the other one, the test could be stopped earlier.
One way to avoid this is to apply a bandit-based algorithm. A such algorithm is able to automatically decide if one of these two treatments should be chosen and applied more often than the other one. This approach, called dynamic allocation, allows to add adaptivity or early stopping to the A/B test. However, bandit theory by traditional methods requires assumptions which are not always verified in reality. This is mainly due to the fact that the subject tested are not homogeneous. In this work, we will present our R package which includes a new method that finds the best variation for homogenous groups in a short period of time.";"poster"

When the population is identical the fridge temperature cycling starts to synchronise causing undesirable power fluctuations. I find that a very small (realistic) amount of parameter heterogeneity prevents these problems, and allows the fridges to provide a valuable service to the grid.";"poster"

"Bergstedt Jacob";"Using R to predict blood cell composition, age, smoking behaviour and infection serostatus from whole-blood DNA methylation profiles";"Quantification of immune cells provide key indicators of human health but are difficult to assess in patients. As cells differentiate, their genome accumulate epigenetic modifications, i.e., stable chemical additions to the DNA, which give rise to cell-specific gene expression. Some epigenetic marks are expected to be cell lineage specific. They therefore convey information about cell identity. We sought to leverage DNA methylation (DNAm), an epigenetic mark involved in cell differentiation, to predict immune cell proportions in whole blood. Because very few DNAm loci are expected to be markers of cellular differentiation, the optimal predictor is linear and sparse. DNAm at 850K loci and proportions of 70 immune cells were measured by the EPIC array and flow cytometry respectively, on the 1,000 individuals of the Milieu Intérieur cohort. We fitted prediction models of blood cell proportions, as well as age, smoking and infection status, using glmnet and stabs in R. Models predicted 30 cell types and the other traits with high accuracy. They will be valuable for various applications, such as correction for cellular heterogeneity, a critical confounder in medical epigenomic studies.";"poster"
"Spijker Job";"Using a data cube to efficiently manage data for machine learning";"To safeguard a healthy environment the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) monitors the quality of air, water and soil. RIVM maintains the National Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (which includes carbon emissions) and curates large repositories with (spatial) data about the ecosystem, public health and energy. Data driven approaches are used to predict the fate of pollutants, nutrients and carbon. E.g. random forests is used to predict nitrogen leaching from the root zone or to link the environmental impact of agricultural practice to diets. Combining monitoring data with data of pollutant emissions, or other spatial data, is labour intensive due to the large amount and diversity of available data. To make this process more efficient we use the principle of a ?data cube'. Spatial data is projected into a multidimensional georeferenced feature space and combined with monitoring data. Using a dedicated R package, data is stored in a database and feature matrices and target variables can be selected easily for subsequent analyses with machine learning algorithms. Through two examples we show how this has greatly enhanced the efficiency of our data driven approach.  ";"poster"

"Grimm Fiona";"Using Shiny to track winter pressures in the UK National Health Service (NHS)";"The NHS in England is under considerable pressure during winter. Within the context of existing funding pressures, demand for hospital care increasingly exceeds the capacity of emergency departments. In recent years, performance targets have consistently been missed on a national level with potentially worrying consequences for care quality and safety. This trend has also received growing media and political attention. Throughout winter the NHS regularly releases provider-level data on performance indicators, such as A&E waiting times and hospital bed occupancy, which are key to understanding quality of care and to inform future planning efforts. However, partly due to inconvenient formatting of the spreadsheets, it takes considerable analytical skill and effort to routinely produce aggregate metrics, examine trends and assess regional variation. We have developed a Shiny app as an interface for visualisation and comparison of a range of NHS performance indicators over winter, aimed at the public, the media and NHS analysts (to be released before useR). The app also shows historical context and the option to aggregate indicators within local areas. With this we aim to provide a convenient, consistent and consolidated way of tracking NHS winter performance indicators. We also want use it as a case study and learning resource to promote the use of R within the NHS via the NHS-R community.";"lightning talk"
"Robbins Hilary";"What R we doing at the International Agency for Research on Cancer?";"The size and scope of cancer data are rapidly increasing, and increasingly diverse analytical approaches are required to understand and prevent cancer. Here, we illustrate how we use R across the continuum of cancer research through specific examples from our work in the Genetic Epidemiology Group at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). First, data management is the foundation of successful statistical analysis. We use R to generate clean and harmonized datasets for clinical, socioeconomic, and omics data (packages: lubridate). Second, cancer surveillance includes trend analysis and extrapolation. We estimated cancer incidence in Thailand in 2030 using breakpoint analysis (segmented), poisson age-period-cohort (apc) analysis (Epi), and power5 apc projection (nordpred). Third, two-sample Mendelian randomization uses genetic proxies to infer whether non-genetic risk factors (eg BMI) cause cancer (TwoSampleMR). Fourth, we predicted individual risk of lung cancer based on biomarkers and other risk factors using penalised regressions and ROC curves, which may improve selection of individuals into CT screening (glmnet, pROC). Finally, a promising clinical application is to identify individuals with sufficiently low lung cancer risk to lengthen their CT screening interval (dplyr, ggplot2, survival, geepack, glmnet, rms).";"poster"
"Raillard Nicolas";"Using R and Shiny to access and analyse hindcast database of sea-states";"The IFREMER, French Institute for Research and Exploitation of the Sea develops a hindcast database of sea-state called HOMERE. This database consists in numerous variables (wave height, direction and period, wind and current speed and direction...) describing the main characteristics of a sea-state along the Atlantic coast, from the North of Spain to the South of Ireland and the English Channel. The database covers 23 years with an irregular and high resolution space grid, from 10km offshore to a few hundred meters onshore. This results in more than 100000 points and 1Tb of data, stored in as many individual netcdf files as nodes. 
In addition, IFREMER and BRGM, the French Geological Survey, have been collaborating for a few years to develop statistical methods for extreme value analysis and modelling, particularly for near-shore applications. This ranges from the assessment of marine structure reliability to the evaluation of coasting flooding hazards. This work results in many R scripts, making it difficult to have a consistent workflow between collaborating teams. 
In this talk, we present a web interface using R and Shiny, to provide an easy access to the HOMERE database and to the developed statistical analysis tools for the environmental conditions: directional aspects, joint distributions and modelling of extreme values (return levels, environmental contours...).";"poster"
"Petersen Anne Helby";"Discovering the cause: Tools for structure learning in R";"Enormous amounts of observational data are being produced every day from internet users, health care providers and satellites alike. This opens up a lot of new possibilities for what observational data may be used for. But if the subject is causality, it is still common to solely rely on externally proposed, ?hypothesis-driven? models, which limits the range of causal inquiries. However, in some cases it is possible to construct a causal model from the data using structure learning. This is not only relevant for those interested in inferring causality. Even when prediction is the goal, knowledge of causal structures is useful for helping domain adaption because the mechanistic nature of causal structures make them more stable. A myriad of packages for structure learning have been developed in R, including pcalg, bnstruct, bnlearn, deal, catnet and stablespec, each of them dedicated to a certain class of causal models (e.g. linear), a specific algorithmic approach (e.g. constraint-based), or a combination of both. In this presentation, I provide an overview of existing R packages for structure learning, focusing on overlaps and differences in functionality, interface and possibilities to include external information. I also discuss how the packages may be integrated into a joint tool, thereby facilitating structure learning without settling on a model class or learning approach a priori.";"poster"

The usage of the package requires to provide code for the likelihood function, for generating a sample from the model, and for the formulation of the interest parameter. The latter is allowed to be a rather general function of the model parameters. The code includes some functions for computing the modified profile likelihood for a multidimensional parameter of interest, and it could also be used to approximate median-unbiased estimation in a parametric statistical model. The features of the package will be illustrated by means of some examples on survival data models, IRT models and mixed models. ";"oral presentation"

"Monteil Celine";"Automatic Calibration by Evolutionary Multi Objective Algorithm: the caRamel R package";"Environmental modelling is complex, and models often require the calibration of several parameters that are not directly evaluable from a physical quantity or a field measurement. Multiobjective calibration enables to establish a compromise between these different objectives by defining a set of optimal parameters. The R package caRamel has been designed to easily implement a multi-objective optimizer in the R environment. The algorithm is a hybrid of the Multiobjective Evolutionary Annealing Simplex method (MEAS) and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (?-NSGA-II algorithm). The optimizer was initially developed for the calibration of hydrological models but can be used for any environmental model. The main function of the package requires to define a function that evaluate the calibration objectives for a set of parameters of the model, and bounds on the parameters to optimize. caRamel is well adapted to a complex model. As an example, caRamel is converging quickly and has a stable solution after 5,000 model evaluations with robust results for a model with 8 parameters and 3 objectives of calibration.";"poster"

However, more enhanced formula and data are often usefull. The new gdata.frame package tackle the case when the data set is characterized by two indexes. Two examples are panel data, for which observations are defined by an individual and a time period, and random utility models, for which observations are defined by a choice situation and an alternative. Moreover, indexes may have a nesting structure: for example, for a panel data of countries, the individual (country) index can be nested in a continent index. With gdata.frame, the indexes are stored as an attribute of the data.frame and extracted series inherit from it, thanks to specific methods for generic extractor functions. Usual operations, like for example group means or deviations from group means can then be computed in a very natural way, ie without having to define each time the series which defines the structure of the data set. gdata.frame therefore provides a generic solution to deal with grouped data. More specific data structure can then be defined that inherit from it. This feature is illustrated using the plm (for panel data) and the mlogit (for discrete choice models) packages.";"oral presentation"

Methods We used data subset from the Seattle Mobile Study, a 2014 survey on migration and HIV risk among 339 MSM aged 18-59, to examine migration trajectories and motivations. Reasons for move, measured on a scale from 1-7 (1 being most important) included: to avoid discrimination related to sexual orientation, live near like-minded people, be near social support, seek sexual partnering opportunities, or find gay-friendly health care. Urbanicity was determined using census data and 1990 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties. Average urbanicity for each participant over pre-Seattle life course was calculated and linearly regressed with mean importance score. All analysis was done using R. Results Increasing ruralness was significantly correlated with increased mean importance score (coef = 0.19, p = 0.01). Motivation importance among MSM moving to Seattle appears higher for those moving from less urban places. Discussion Importance of sexual orientation-related motivations for MSM urban-centric migration was associated with urbanicity of previous locations. Further studies should use larger samples, compare other cities, and assess change over time.  ";"lightning talk"

Students usually experiment difficulties to assimilate the notion of statistics as random variables with their own probability distribution. This work presents the strategy used at the National University of Rosario, Argentina, where we use R to simulate and analyze interactively the distribution of statistics, making use of sliders, pickers and other controls to choose different characteristics for the simulation. The function simularDistrMedia lets us study the sampling distribution of the mean, with controls for the number of simulations, sample size, original distribution of the variable (normal or not) and its population mean and variance. For each selection of parameters plots are updated to show a histogram of the simulated means, a boxplot and a quantile-quantile normal plot. Also, the plots present theoretical and empirical density curves and summary statistics, so that the students can compare and draw conclusions. The functions simularDistrS2 and simularDistrProp let us study the sampling distributions of the variance and proportion in an analogous fashion.

We assume that any kind of R project (data analysis, R package, shiny applications) can embrace the literate programming paradigm: explanation of the program logic in natural langage interlaced with code snippets. Hence, Rmarkdown files are ideal candidates for reproducible projects and workflows.
The ""Rmd first"" approach proposes a project in four parts: (1) Prototype: keep track of data explorations, graphs and tables using Rmd files. (2) Package: regularly transform code chunks into functions to simplify and clarify reading. Extracted functions are documented and tested. The Rmd file ends as the vignette of the package. (3) Modularize: separate projects into multiple sub-parts, hence Rmd files. It simplifies participation of multiple developers by reducing potential files conflicts. (4) Deploy: use available tools to share your work, confidentially or publicly. In a vignette documented package, automated report may be built with {bookdown}, a website may present the full documentation with {pkgdown}.

"Krainski Elias";"A toolbox for fitting non-separable space-time log-Gaussian Cox models using R-INLA";"Many processes have space-time non-separable dynamics (e.g. disease spread and species distribution) which should be accounted for during modeling. A non-separable stochastic partial differential approach (SPDE) can be used to consider the realistic space-time evolution of the process in which the spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the latent field are linked (Krainski 2018). Observations of these processes are often measured as point-referenced locations in time, i.e. space-time point patterns. The log-Gaussian Cox process model is a popular class to model point patterns. However, it can be difficult fit in practice because the likelihood depends on an integral over the spatial and temporal domains. Implement these models in R-INLA is challenging because it involves several steps. We provide a step-by-step approach to constructing a space-time model in R-INLA using fox rabies as a case study. We discuss several useful updates to the R-INLA package (e.g. inlabru), including improvements to the integration methods in space and time and options to improve computational performance. We also discuss several practical considerations for users to consider in model construction including mesh generation, model implementation, model checking and extensions to the basic model.

In particular, we see that the proposed approach achieves 98% of utilization rate with 1000x faster in time comparing to the global optimum solution. We then show the usefulness of having this solver with a business case where it empowered us developing a machine learning approach for shipping box design.";"oral presentation"
"Henry Lionel";"Reusing tidyverse code, the easy way";"In 2017 the tidyverse grammars were reimplemented on top of tidy evaluation, a metaprogramming framework from the rlang package. Tidy eval makes it possible to program flexibly and robustly with data masking functions from packages like dplyr or ggplot2. However, possible does not mean easy. Tidy eval has the major downside of requiring to learn new programming concepts and tools. In this talk, we'll focus on easier techniques to reuse code from tidyverse pipelines without such a steep learning curve: mapping columns, using fixed column names, passing dots, subsetting the `.data` pronoun, and interpolating expressions. These techniques will help you write functions around tidyverse pipelines and reduce code duplication in your scripts.";"oral presentation"
"Owokotomo Olajumoke Evangelina";"Predicting Risk Groups for Survival of Cancer Patients Using a Robust Metabolomic Signature: The MetabolicSurv R package";"Recent research in oncology is focused on developing robust signature for patient survival using various form of high dimensional omics platforms such as gene expression data, metabolic data and RNAseq, in order to gain a better insight in identifying patients with high-risk for mortality. This method has received a lot of attention in the literature with many authors advocating its usage based on its delineation in discriminating patients. For metabolic data, despite the several research carried out in this area, the software to conduct this type of analysis is not yet available. To address this, a new R package was developed, the MetabolicSurv package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetabolicSurv/index.html), aimed at closing the gap by providing a user-friendly data analysis tool both for modelling and visualization. The package incorporates different methods (supervised PCA, supervised PLS, majority voting, Lasso and elastic net) to develop the signature for predicting survival and classifying patients into low and high-risk group for mortality. The package allows integrating patient-specific clinical data and metabolic data in order to develop the signature and therefore allows the usage of the most updated and relevant patient data in developing the signature. We illustrate the usage of the MetabolicSurv package using a study of 149 lung cancer patients.";"poster"
"Guernec Gregory";"OTRECOD: Using Optimal Transport theory in database fusion for recoding heterogeneous variables";"Database merging is a current operation for any user who frequently manipulates data. Nevertheless, when the databases of interest are constructed from heterogeneous sources (by example collected at different places and/or at different times), it is not unusual that different encodings (different scales by example) are used for some shared keys variables, making data fusion often difficult or even impossible.

For resolving this problem, we propose an original recoding approach using optimal transportation theory (G. Monge, 1781). Indeed, this approach gives us an application to map the measure associated with the key variable in the first database to that associated with the same key variable in the other database. This idea was made possible by minimizing the expectation of a cost function using a distance measure in the space of the common covariates and by introducing an allocation function using an adapted k-nearest neighbors algorithm. 


We now propose an R package called OTRECOD to make easily accessible this theory to R users, which gather the algorithm of this original approach in few flexible functions with some interesting options.

"Leodolter Maximilian";"runDTW: An algorithm to detect prototypical patterns in long time series";"Subsequence matching and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are two well-known research areas in time series analysis [1] . The combination of both concepts in terms of matching time series subsequences via the distance measure DTW is not trivial due to the quadratic runtime complexity of DTW and the typical large number of possible subsequences within one long time series. We propose the algorithm runDTW (to be released with version 1.0.6 of IncDTW on CRAN by end of March 2019) which accelerates the search in a long time series for the k-nearest subsequences of a multivariate time series query pattern by (1) incrementally updating of the normalization and the DTW cost matrix by recycling previous computation results, and (2) by lower bounding and early abandoning to skip and abandon unnecessary computations. We apply runDTW on a database of multivariate accelerometer time series collected via smartphones while travelling with different transport modes. runDTW enables detecting transport mode specific patterns in accelerometer records in acceptable runtime, and provides insight into the transport mode specific data to improve transport mode classification.  [1] Fu, Tak-chung.

We developed a web-based Shiny app to help agribusiness professionals calculate and improve the Nutri-Score of their products. A first feature consists in loading user's product nutritional composition table and automatically calculating score for all products. Using ggplot2 and ggiraph, the user visualizes score repartition in all her/his products database, filtering according to her/his own variables. Officer allows user to pick up desired graphs for automatic report. Then, from a product and score target (from A to E) selected by user, all combinations of components (expressed as contents ranges) complying with target are generated. Only the closest combinations to the initial nutritional composition are displayed to user. She/he can also choose varying components. In this way, user gets conceivable solutions to improve nutritional quality of her/him products by saving her/him valuable time.";"lightning talk"
"Baker Laurie";"Outfoxing Rabies: A case study for fitting non-separable space-time log-Gaussian cox models using R-INLA";"Many processes are strongly linked in space and time for which it is natural to model these two characteristics of the process jointly (e.g. disease spread, fish aggregations). However, developing models that can capture spatiotemporal processes remains a challenge, due to a lack of computationally efficient statistical approaches for model fitting. The integrated nested Laplace approximation algorithm (INLA) speeds up computation and provides a flexible framework for fitting latent Gaussian models in a Bayesian context (Rue et al., 2009). Within the INLA framework, the stochastic partial different equation (SPDE) approach constructs flexible fields to model datasets with complex spatial structure (Lindgren et al. 2011). Krainski (2018) has extended the SPDE model to consider the realistic space-time evolution of the process through a non-separable space-time SPDE model in which the spatial and temporal autocorrelation in the latent field are linked. Using fox rabies as a case study, we illustrate how this approach can be used to capture the spatiotemporal nature of disease transmission. We model the fox rabies case data as arising from a log-Gaussian Cox point process and fit the model using R-INLA. In this poster we present the results of this analysis and discuss several practical considerations for users to consider in model construction, implementation, and model checking.";"poster"

Their popularity is growing in natural science, particularily for studying social-ecological systems like farms, forests or fisheries. In these systems, decision-making processes and practices are no easily taken into account by classical experimental approaches.

We developed an original approach that aims to visualize and analyse perceptions, knowledge and practices of managers in social-ecological systems. Based on the usage of R, we contributed to and developed two Shiny Applications that aims to (i) qualitatively code textual documents, like transcribed open-ended interviews ('qcoder') and to (ii) treat the outputs of the qualitative coding in order to draw cognitive maps ('cogmapr'). Cognitive maps are digraphs of variables that can be used as a semi-qualitative model of interviewees' worldviews. The ?cogmapr' tool contains major functions from our 'Cognitive Mapping Approach for Analysing Actors' Systems of Practices' : drawing Individual Cognitive Maps, computing Social Cognitive Maps and main indicators from the graph theory.

Some new solutions appeared in 2018 and 2019 and will be discussed in this talk.   Among them, the 'RWsearch' package was developed to facilitate the maintenance of the 'Distributions' task view (which is ranked number five by the number of referred packages) but can be used by every R users. It includes a comprehensive set of functions to download the packages and task view master files from CRAN, explore these files, search packages by keywords, date of publication and sophisticated options, display the results as a data.frame or as a classical text in console, txt, html or pdf outputs, download the whole package documentation in one click (a wonderful function for people who need to work offline) and, for task views, compare the results with the list of already referred packages.

"Goehry Benjamin";"Random forests for time series";"Random forests were introduced in 2001 by Breiman and have since become a popular learning algorithm, for both regression and classification. However, when dealing with time series, random forests do not integrate the time-dependent structure and treat each instant as an independent observation. In this study, we propose the rangerts, an extended version of the ranger package for time series.

Goehry (2018) proved under right hypotheses on parameters and the time series that random forests are consistent. In practice, the idea is to replace the IID bootstrapping with dependent bootstrapping to subsample time series during the tree construction phase to take time dependency into account. 

We tested our package both on numerical simulations and the real world applications on electricity load and show our method improves forests' accuracy in some cases. We discuss also how to make a good choice of the key parameters. References Breiman L. Random forests, Machine Learning, vol. 45, no.1, pp. 5?32, 2001. Goehry B.

"Vaughan Davis";"Simple Arrays";"Within the tidyverse, the core structure that powers many packages is the tibble, a modern reimagining of the data frame. Unfortunately, with the large focus on data frames, the array has been left behind. The rray package is an attempt to change that. By borrowing ideas from tibble, rray hopes to create ?simpler arrays? that are more predictable to use and program around. To accomplish this, rray provides the following new infrastructure:   An rray class, which never drops dimensions while subsetting, and consistently retains dimension names where possible.    Broadcasting semantics, using the xtensor library. rray implements the wildly popular idea of broadcasting, originally found in the Python library, numpy, to allow more intuitive and powerful operations between multiple rray objects. This opens up a much more complete set of operations than is currently possible with base R.    A consistent toolkit for common array manipulation tasks, such as computing sums and products along any axis. Each function retains dimensionality by default, making it easy to link operations together through broadcasting. Importantly, this toolkit works with base R arrays as well as with the new rray objects.  https://davisvaughan.github.io/rray/ https://github.com/DavisVaughan/rray";"oral presentation"

Unfortunately, the forecasting functions in that package are not flexible enough for different research purposes. For example, exponential smoothing, implemented in ets() function does not allow using explanatory variables, setting the initial values of the states vector and does not allow fitting models to the data with periodicity higher than 24. This motivated the original development of the package back in 2015, with the main aim of making the research in forecasting area ?smooth?. Four years later, the smooth package has a handful of flexible forecasting functions useful for different research purposes, implementing ETS, ARIMA, vector exponential smoothing, simulation functions and more. In this presentation we will discuss the main functions of the package, show their advantages and disadvantages, and show how they can be applied for the solution of the real world forecasting problems and complement ?forecast' and other widely used packages.";"oral presentation"

"Sax Christoph";"tsbox: Class-Agnostic Time Series";"The R ecosystem knows a vast number of time series classes: ts, xts, zoo, tsibble, tibbletime or timeSeries. The plethora of standards causes confusion. As different packages rely on different classes, it is hard to use them in the same analysis. tsbox provides a set of tools that make it easy to switch between these classes. It also allows the user to treat time series as plain data frames, facilitating the use with tools that assume rectangular data.

The package is built around a set of functions that convert time series of different classes to each other. They are frequency-agnostic, and allow the user to combine multiple non-standard and irregular frequencies. Because coercion works reliably, it is easy to write functions that work identically for all classes. So whether we want to smooth, scale, differentiate, chain-link, forecast, regularize or seasonally adjust a time series, we can use the same tsbox-command for any time series class. The talk provides a general overview of time series classes in R and shows how tsbox can be used to facilitate the interaction between them.";"oral presentation"

Using data from Kaggle, 7043 customer information with 21 features each, the results of the study show the highest accuracy of 79% in SVM when predicting churn rate and the most prominent variable for high churn rate was ""the use of Online Security"". We also developed a web-based platform with RShiny package that visualize the patterns of customers who would churn with have high probability.

Unwilling to fall asleep child can change one's life into a nightmare and those, who calmly sleep long hours used to be the object of desire. There are many functions, that the parents try to optimize - some simply want their children to sleep as much as possible, some want to wake up later and enjoy their kids in the evenings or the opposite (you cannot have it all), in our case we also wanted to synchronize sleeping times of our two children. To reach the goal, they try to find some patterns in children`s behavior ? they impose some daily routines, do not let children nap too long during the daytime or try to put them in bed earlier, hoping that slower pace will lull them. However intuitions may be misleading, and that is why after a few months of observing my children sleeping patterns I decided to hire statistical tools. I wanted to verify the hypothesis if we should wake them up earlier in the morning (which in case of our kids turned out to be true), but the framework allowed me to detect also some more useful patterns and draw hints. After first attempts with linear regression, I decided to introduce my kids to the neural network and let it learn. My further idea is to create a web app, where one can upload a data file with observed sleeping times and habits, which would help draw reliable conclusions. ";"lightning talk"

"Canonici Merle Elie";"Typing R";"For a long time now, programming langages have been divided in two categories, dynamically typed ones and statically typed ones.Both sides tend to argue that their system has more inherent benefits than drawbacks according to their needs. On one hand it is convenient to have a system that allows writing non well typed programs that you know to be correct. On the other hand, no programmer is ever safe from a silly mistake taking ages to be fixed, if ever detected, in his code base. Thus, with the ever growing usage of dynamically typed langages such as R or javascript, it has become increasingly important to detect mistakes as early as possible in the deveopment process. By adapting some approaches inherited from the strongly statically typed langages community we have developped a typing system for a fragment of the R programming language. We argue that it does not restrict the expresiveness of the R language beyond what is actually widely used. Moreover we have embedded a type checker in a state of the art integrated development environment leveraging the graphical interface to report useful errors to the user.";"oral presentation"
"Mørk Kristoffer";"Estimate, Estimator, Estimand?";"Over the past few years, the term ?Estimand' has become a buzzword in the pharmaceutical industry. The ICH E9 addendum[1] introduces the latest theory of estimands. An estimand can be seen as a description of what has to be estimated in order to answer a scientific question of interest in a clinical trial. Hence, an estimand forms the basis for an estimator and the corresponding estimate. Several estimators can be defined for an estimand with one being the primary estimator and the others being sensitivity estimators. We have created a shiny app to illustrate the concept of estimands. The shiny app considers a clinical trial within type 1 diabetes mellitus with a parallel group design and repeated measurements of a continuous variable. Some of the data is missing due to withdrawals and eventually due to the defined estimand. The shiny app handles the missing data problem by using some of the multiple imputation methods implemented in the R package MICE. Some extra functionalities have been developed in order to ease the use of the MICE package in a clinical trial setup. The theory of estimands may also be useful in other settings than clinical trials.

The resulting package, (RcppEigenAD), allows the user to define matrix valued functions of matrix arguments in c++ and seamlessly integrate them into an R session in a way that allows not only for computing the function but also their Jacobian and Hessian. The package also includes an implementation of Faa di Bruno's formula for calculating the partial derivatives of the composition of functions defined by the user.

As an optimization algorithm, GA (Genetic Algorithm) was used. In our physical simulation, we considered two options. The first option is about position and velocity when forces are applied to the body. We solved this dynamic equation of a robot's body placed in 2-dimensional space using the 3rd order Runge-Kutta method. The second option is for constraining the position and velocity when a body contacts the ground. The sequences of the robot's body position were visualized with animation package in R. This virtual robot has a body, and five parameters determine its walking trajectory. GA package in R was used to optimize these parameters.

In addition, most existing studies have assumed that short-term PM2.5-mortality associations were linear. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive, evidence-based assessment of the disease burden related to short-term PM2.5 exposure in China. Here, we explored the non-linear association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and all-cause mortality in 104 counties in China; estimated county-specific mortality burdens attributable to short-term PM2.5 exposure for all counties in the country and analyzed spatial characteristics of the mortality burden due to short-term PM2.5 exposure in China using R. The pooled PM2.5-mortality association was non-linear, with a reversed J-shape. We found an approximately linear increased risk of mortality from 0 to 62 ?g/m3 and decreased risk from 62 to 250 ?g/m3. We estimated a total of 169,862 additional deaths from short-term PM2.5 exposure throughout China in 2015. Short-term PM2.5 exposure contributed greatly to the death burden in China, approximately one seventh of the estimates from the chronic effect. Traditional linear effect models likely underestimated the mortality burden due to short-term exposure to PM2.5.";"poster"

We will present the effectiveness of this tool with some real use cases and demo. Time Series ExploreR provides four functions that enable time series analysis process interactively. First, it provides time series visualization at various time interval to understand the time series. Second, it provides nessesary information for time series analysis.(e.g. missing value, frequency distribution, correlation, periodic component) Third, it provides basic feature extraction from uni- or multi-variate time series. Fourth, these features are also useful for multiple time series anomaly detection methods. By performing these processes interactively on the web apps using Shiny, it becomes possible to analyze time series data easily and quickly for data scientists.";"poster"
"Olusoji Oluwafemi";"?cyanoFilter?, An Automated Framework for identifying Synechococcus type cyanobacteria populations obtained via flow cytometry";"Flow cytometry is a well-known technique for identifying cell populations in fluids. It is largely applied in biological and medical sciences for cell sorting, counting, biomarker detections and protein engineering. Identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data often rely on manual gating, a subjective and generally irreproducible method based on expert knowledge. To address this issue, two filtering frameworks were developed in R, identifying and filtering out two strains of Synechococcus type cyanobacteria from flow cytometry data. The first framework employs a one and two-dimensional kernel density approach on two fluorescence channels believed to characterize the cyanobacteria populations while the second employs a multivariate normal approach on five fluorescence channels believed to characterize these cyanobacteria populations. We apply both proposed techniques to data from growth curve experiments of the cyanobacteria in mono- and biculture. We observe that both approaches produced similar growth curves of the cyanobacteria population and cyanobacteria counts within 10% difference range. These two frameworks are currently being developed into an R package, cyanoFilter, for use of others doing flow cytometry experiments involving cyanobacteria.";"poster"
"Dutang Christophe";"Maximum spacing estimation, a new method in fitdistrplus";"Maximum spacing estimation (MSE) introduced by [1] is a method for estimating the parameters based on the probability differences of order statistics. 
More precisely, the method consists in maximizing of the geometric mean of spacings in the data, which are the differences between the values of the distribution function at sorted observations. MSE has been proved to be reliable method both for heavy-tailed models by [2] and lighted-tailed models by [1]. Currently, only the BMT package provides the MSE for a single distribution. In this talk, we study the development and integration of this method in the fitdistrplus package [3]. This latter package provides maximum likelihood and other methods for any distribution characterized by d, p, q functions. Using the S3 class and generic methods, this estimation method nicely fits the package framework. An uncertainty analysis is carried out on simulated datasets from both light and heavy tailed models. Finally, we illustrate the relevancy of this method to model insurance losses on real actuarial datasets. [1] Ranneby, Bo (1984). The maximum spacing method.

"Therneau Terry";"The next generation of the survival package";"With over 650 dependent packages, two guiding lights for the survival package are that ""you can't do everything"" and ""don't break it"". As a consequence, although there has been continuous improvement in the underlying algorithms, additions of major new functionality are rare. Version 3 is an exception. Major additions include much broader support for multi-state models, cacluation of absolute risk estimates, and data checking. A design goal was to make multi-state models as easy to fit and use as a single state coxph or survfit model, and to make absolute risk estimates as easy as a Kaplan-Meier curve --- all without rocking the boat with respect to current software. Why do this? The classic triad of Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox model are reliable tools for time-to-event data that has a single endpoint. However, in the authors' own work single endpoint models have now become the minority. We will give an example from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging where keeping track of multiple endpoints is a key part of the analysis: the progression from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia; low/medium/high levels of underlying neurodegeneration, the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain, and of course status of alive/dead. We will illustrate the new usages, and discuss how other packages can plug into this functionality and where to find further documentation and examples.";"oral presentation"

Such a study requires a large variety of tools, ranging from design of experiments to optimization algorithms with nonlinear regression models, as well as user-friendly visualization techniques.
To facilitate our engineers work at Safran, we decided to build an R/Shiny application which gives them easy access to state-of-the-art R packages and in-house research advances.This platform is deployed via a system of secured containers for all Safran engineers: they only need to use their browser and connect to the container system to enjoy interactive visualizations and efficient algorithms.

It is intended for those who are not statisticians (doctors, psychologists, salespeople,...) but who nevertheless need high-level professional statistics. R++ is a result of collaborations with different computer-science labs specialised in Human-Computer Interaction. Through twenty or so meetings with statisticians, we have identified the tasks that are considered to be arduous, annoying or of low added value. 3 aspects have arisen: reading data (encoding problems, column separators, odd formats, distant data bases), data managment (outliers' detection, modalities' merging,...) and exporting results (text or graph). R ++ offers an easy-to-use interface simplifying processing these tasks. In reading the data, a preview is displayed allowing checking of the data and thus to proceed to various settings. For processing the data, several tools are available. For example, it is possible to instantly graphicaly represent all the variables of a database or to correct the types using a colour system. For exporting the data, interface allows adjustments to graphical settings, then a simple drag&drop can export graphs. Naturally, for the sake of reproducibility of analyses, each action generates the corresponding R code. A code editor and an R console are also available for more advanced uses. R++ is free for academics, students, and associations.";"lightning talk"

"Kalibera Tomas";"Sustainable Package Development";"Writing and maintaining packages is an essential contribution to the R community. Despite a number of formal requirements on packages, most of the internal details of the language can be inspected and modified through reflective features and a rich C API, giving a lot of freedom to package developers. This probably contributed to the popularity of R, but poses a risk when not used responsibly.

R needs to adapt to the changing needs of its users and to changes in the software/hardware environments in which it is used. As of today, almost any change in the R runtime, however minute, breaks some packages. The causes are hard to find especially when the change is to undocumented R behavior or when it ""wakes up"" an old bug. Tests using all CRAN/BIOC packages are run routinely, requiring expensive hardware. Debugging requires skill, experience, knowledge of R internals and typically much more time than the implementation of the change that caused the bug. It is done by R Core and adds to the workload of repository maintainers.

This talk is an inspiration for package authors who want to develop packages responsibly, without unnecessarily increasing the cost of maintenance and evolution of R. It will include advice and examples based on my work on the R runtime (and debugging of packages) related to PROTECT bugs, in-place modification of immutable values, memory management at the C/C++ boundary, and parse data fixes.";"oral presentation"

Flow data represent movements of people or goods between two spatial locations, for example in migration, international trade, transportation. Gravity models, which have been extensively used for this purpose, include a function of distance between origin and destination among the explanatory variables to account for the spatial dimension. To further eliminate the spatial structure present in this type of data, we implement two fitting methods for spatial autoregressive models accounting for spatial dependence between flows: a Bayesian approach and a three stage least squares approach. We discuss impacts measures evaluation as well and extend these computations to the case of different characteristics at origin and destination. Contrary to existing programs, our implementation with the R language also allows for a different list for origins and destinations.

The automated processing chain was developed in R and includes four main steps: - the automatic delineation of catchments boundaries from a digital elevation model by coupling R with GRASS GIS (rgrass7 package) and FORTRAN codes - the estimation of climate inputs at the catchment-scale by crossing catchment boundaries and climatic grids (raster package) - the use of a ""shiny"" interface including dynamic leaflet maps and real time upstream drainage basins to ease the expertise on the exact location of hydrometric stations - the production of synthetic sheets cross-referencing various hydrological, topographical and climatic data at the basin scale with dynamic graphs (dygraphs package) and static graphics (available at http://webgr.irstea.fr/activites/base-de-donnees/) This presentation will show how the developments made in R and existing packages were combined and implemented for building a large database at the national scale for research and operational applications in hydrology.";"poster"

"Bichat Antoine";"Impact of tree choice in metagenomics differential abundance studies";"In microbial ecology, a commonly held belief states that the taxonomy reflects ecological niches and that closely related species are therefore to be abundant at the same time. This belief has prompted the development of several statistical methods that leverage the tree-like structure of taxonomy when detecting differentially abundant taxa. Although it is true for datasets spanning different ecological niches at high taxonomic ranks, in general it is not. We investigated the similarity between the tree of correlation between taxa and the taxonomic tree using a two-pronged approach: we first tested whether the taxonomy was in the confidence region of the tree of correlation before testing whether both trees were significantly closer than two random trees. To do so, we relied on three distances on the space of trees. Confidence regions were determined by bootstrapping and typical distances between random trees by permuting the leaves labels. Based on those distances applied to several publicly available datasets, we conclude that the taxonomy and the tree of correlation are in general no closer than two random trees, although some exceptions were observed in dataset with strongly differentiated niches (different body sites for example). This suggests that using the taxonomy offers no tangible benefits over other hierarchical structures when studying differentially abundant taxa. ";"poster"
"Nassiri Vahid";"clustDRM: an R package and Shiny app for modeling high- throughput dose-response data";"Dose-response modeling is a crucial step in drug discovery and safety assessment. R packages like ""drc"" and ""DoseFinding"" provide useful tools to fit dose-response models and estimate parameters such as effective doses. When it comes to modeling dose-response patterns of several compounds (e.g., in high content screening studies), one may face with three different challenges:  1. the dose-response relationship may be non-existent (flat patterns),  2. no single dose-response model fits the data well enough,  3. due to the use of often complex non-linear models the estimation could become computationally intensive (especially in a high-throughput setting).  To address these issues, we have developed an R package called 'clustDRM` that provides a unified platform to analyze dose-response relationships in a high-throughput setting. The package uses a two-stage approach. First, it filters out the compounds with a flat dose-response pattern and identifies the patterns of the non-flat ones. Next, it fits a set of appropriate dose-response models (accounting for the previously identified patterns) and uses model-averaging to estimate effective doses and their standard errors. Parallel computations are used to address the third issue. Furthermore, a Shiny app accompanies the package to make its use easier for scientists from various fields without deep knowledge of R.";"oral presentation"
"Janssenswillen Gert";"propro: Enhancing Discovered Process Models using Bayesian Inference and MCMC";"Process mining is an innovative research field aimed at extracting useful information about business processes from event data. An important task herein is process discovery; the discovery of process models from data. The results of process discovery are mainly deterministic process models, which do not convey a notion of probability or uncertainty. In this paper, Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to build a statistical model on top of a process model using event data, which is able to generate probability distributions for choices in a process' control-flow. A generic algorithm to build such a model is presented, and it is shown how the resulting statistical model can be used to test different kinds of hypotheses, such as non-deterministic dependencies between different choices in the model. The algorithm is implemented in a new R package, named propro, for probabilistic process models. In this paper, it is shown how propro can be used in real-life process analysis scenarios and leads to valuable information about the processes under consideration, which go beyond the discovery of static control-flow. As a result, propro supports the enhancement of discovered process models by exposing probabilistic dependencies, and allows to compare the quality among different models, each of which provides important advancements in the field of process mining.";"oral presentation"
"Ritz Christian";"Advances in dose-response analysis";"During the last few decades, dose-response analysis, which is fitting and interpreting results obtained from using fully parametric nonlinear dose-response (regression) models, has undergone dramatic changes, from cumbersome, more or less manual calculations and transformations to blink-of-an-eye operations on any laptop.

The first version of the R extension package ""drc"" for doing dose-response analysis was developed in 2005. Originally, it was developed for fitting log-logistic models that were used routinely in toxicology and pesticide science. Subsequently, the package has been extensively revised, mostly in response to feedback from the user community. By now, it has developed into a veritable ecosystem for all kinds of dose-response analyses. Similar functionality for dose-response analysis does not exist in any other statistical software.

This talk briefly reviews the development, mentinoning methods that have become obsolete, methods that have stayed in use, and new methods that have been incorporated. Changes have largely been propelled by the advent of powerful extension packages. Specifically, we will talk about modular use of multiple packages when doing dose-response analysis. We will show examples on modelling of event times, binary mixtures and species sensitivity distributions. Finally, we will outline a number of directions for future developments.

The polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard exam, conducted to diagnose the majority of disorders. It consists of an overnight record of body functions, including electroencephalography, eyes movements, muscles activities, respiratory flows, and heart activity. PSGs produces many data, mostly in the form of high-frequency time series. In the classical clinical process, Medical Doctors or Sleep Technologists visually score records, assigning stages and events to the multivariate time serie. This is a time-consuming task, taking a few hours for each record; therefore automating the process is a real need. At the sleep center of the Hôtel-Dieu, Paris, we use R to visualize, analyze and automatically score sleep records. Heterogeneous sleep data can be easily displayed in an interactive way using Shiny. New representations, including 3D projections of sleep stages are provided to medical teams. Machine learning algorithms are trained on previous recorded and annotated records of the center. Reports are built using R Tex and publishing related packages to bring the information smoothly in the existing clinical process.

For (later) re-use of data, the metadata associated with data sets is as important as the data itself. But when ?normal' researchers are asked to provide metadata, the enthusiasm is severely dampened due to the complexities of most metadata schemes. It is generally easy to provide general (?bibliographic?) metadata, but this type of metadata is often not very useful when trying to find the data one is looking for. Going further, the definitions of the schemes are so complex, that only somebody very familiar with these (and preferebly fluent in reading and writing of xml) is able to use them to their full potential. Consequently, metadata remains the poor stepchild of data sets. I will present an approach which tries to overcome this weakness by 1) being driven by scientists in the specific field and their needs to find other data sets which can be used in their research
2) building an R package to define the metadata scheme
3) use a spreadsheet to enter the metadata per experiment and not per dataset

An unnecessary movement of a vehicle can cause additional cost in the range of several hundred Euros. When scaled to high volume production and delivery of cars, the importance of optimized processes becomes clear. At the BMW Group, we are faced with the delivery of millions of cars a year. In order to optimize our parking space allocation we employed process mining methods that describe and evaluate the movements that took place. We present the analysis of these results and how weak points in the process such as bottle necks or loops could be identified. In particular, we evaluated standby times, transport times and process times and secondly, the process flow and the associated resources. This enabled us to uncover inefficiencies and quantify the optimization potential. Following this thorough analysis, we implemented a recommendation algorithm that suggests an optimal allocation of the parking spaces. The metric optimized by our algorithm is the standing time in the storage locations. All analysis is based on the BMW Group's internal distribution. We show that the algorithm can reduce the number of transfers and improves the use of parking space, as measured in terms of standing time.";"poster"
"Fox John";"A Generalized Framework for Parametric Regression Splines";"Regression splines are piecewise polynomials constrained to join smoothly at boundaries called knots. They are traditionally viewed as an alternative to other methods for modeling nonlinear relationships, such as transformations, polynomial regression, and nonparametric regression. Regression splines are parametric and are implemented by introducing a regression-spline basis into the model matrix for a linear or similar regression model. It is usual not to focus on the estimated parameters for a regression spline but instead to represent the model graphically, and traditional regression-spline bases, such as B-splines and natural splines, respectively implemented in the bs() and ns() functions in the R splines package, are selected for numerical stability rather than interpretability. The emphasis on graphical interpretation makes sense but also represents a missed opportunity. We introduce generalized regression splines, implemented in the gspline() in the carEx package, which support the specification of a much wider variety of regression-spline and piecewise-polynomial models using bases that are associated with interpretable parameters.";"oral presentation"

I will present two packages which help to solve this problem: 1) COGugaison [1], which provides functions for converting a spatial dataset from one year to what it would be (or have been) another year. The package handles when the territories gather and split. 2) CARTElette [2], which contains geographical layers corresponding to the annual division of French territories that can be loaded directly into R's popular {sf} format. Thanks to these two packages, it is for example possible to look at the evolution of the number of women in France in each French department since 1975 taking into account that some of the territories have changed during this period [3]. At this time, those packages only concern France and are therefore only documented in French.

Therefore, appliances should be remotely controllable. One approach to achieve this is to plug devices into smart plugs that can automatically be switched on or off. A further important aspect of smart plugs is that they provide a very precise measurement of the consumed power with high granularity. This allows for a clear energy breakdown and energy efficiency analysis. However, all of these services need a good understanding and ability to gain insights from the power consumption data. To this end, we trained a random forest classifier with high accuracy to identify big consumers when plugged into a smart plug. Furthermore, a state detection algorithm was implemented to determine the exact starting and ending times of a device in order to react precisely according to the services that are demanded by the customer. Finally, as all valuable insights are useless if not made available in an appealing manner so that they can be used by the end consumer, all our algorithms are summarized in a Smart Home Shiny App.";"poster"

Its main goal is to help to develop, debug, and analyze usage of our apps. Multiple-line events logging can be done simultaneously, not only to R console, but also to your browser JavaScript console, so you can see logged events in the real-time, using your app already deployed to a server (shinyapps.io, rsconnect). Moreover, your events (together with unique sesssionID and timestamp) can be saved as a text file or into a remote database (currently MongoDB), and be ready for further analysis with the help of process-mining techniques from ?bupaR' package. You can log different types of events, for example:
* log_event(?Hello World!?),
* log_value(input$variable),
* log_output(str(mtcars)),
* log_test(testthat::expect_true(TRUE)),
* and others (errors, warnings, messages). You can time nested events for performance analysis. If you are logging a value of an evaluated expression, not only the value will be logged but also the expression itself, so ?log_value(NROW(mtcars))? gives you: |#1|VALUE|NROW(mtcars)|FIRED|
|#1|32 Each event can be logged with a list of parameters that are event-specific or common for a group of events. CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyEventLogger

regional patterns to your target audience. Current data sources often contain location data making maps a natural visualisation choice.
While these detailed location data are fine for analytic purposes, derived statistiscs have the
risk of disclosing information of individual persons. For example if one plots the spatial distribution of income or getting social welfare, sparsely populated areas may be very revealing. Statistical procedures to control disclosure have been readily available (sdcTable, sdcMicro), but those focus on protecting tabulated or microdata, not on protecting spatial data as such.

Several authors (bloggers, researchers and data scientists) have proposed various options for model validation and by extension the appropriate percentage of DS based on three disjoint datasets splitting (3-DDS); training, test, cross validation and test set respectively. Previous literature recognizes only two disjoint split (2-DDS) for validation the skill of machine learning algorithm. As an addition, we extend each of the existing cross validation (CV) approaches using the new/modern three disjoint splitting (3-DDS) approach. We also examined the relevance of various CV procedures using various m (training size). Preliminary result shows that the 3-DDS approach provides a more robust assessment of the generalization error of the final chosen model which is not available in 2-DDS approach and has equal performance in assessing the prediction error of the selected model as 2-DDS approach. Our finding also shows that, as m increases, any arbitrary splitting percentage can be adopted provided that m is large and test set is ? 50% of m while the validation and test set takes equal percentage.";"poster"
"Genuer Robin";"How to speed-up VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forests)?";"The VSURF package is a general tool to perform variable selection for regression or supervised classification problems. It implements a fully data-driven variable selection procedure based on random forests (RF). Its overall run-time depends obviously on the data characteristics (number of observations, n, and number of variables, p, mostly), but also on the computational performance of the randomForest package (since VSURF is heavily based on it). In the last few years, other packages implementing RF (ranger, Rborist) have emerged, and their authors claim that they are faster than randomForest: in the high-dimensional case (p very large and larger than n) for ranger, and in the Big data context (n extremely large) for Rborist. Therefore, one way to speed-up VSURF is to use those other packages instead of randomForest in the procedure. In this talk, RF basics are first given, then the VSURF procedure is detailed, and finally different implementations of RF into VSURF are compared in several frameworks and on different examples, to shed light on when each implementation can or cannot alleviate the overall computation burden.";"oral presentation"

Variable sensitivity analysis methods are a well studied and established set of tools designed to overcome these sorts of problems. In most cases, those methods require a functional or computer code producing the output variable. Also, they fail to capture relevant features and patterns hidden within the geometry of the enveloping manifold projected onto a variable. In this talk we propose an index that captures, reflects and correlates the relevance of distinct variables within a model by focusing on the geometry of their projections. We first construct the 2-simplices of a Vietoris-Rips complex and then estimate the area of those objects from a data-set cloud. Afterwards, through affine transformations we propose our geometric sensitivity index. As a side result, we could also estimate the regression curve of the data-set generate solely by the estimated manifold. We compile all the analysis in an original package called TopSA (https://github.com/maikol-solis/TopSA), short for Topological Sensitivity Analysis. The package exploits the facility of the package `simple features` (sf) to handle all the geometric operations.

"Valcarcel Alessandra";"rtapas: an R package for subject-specific threshold detection in automatic lesion segmentation using multi-modal MRI";"Total brain white matter lesion (WML) volume is the most widely established magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome measure in studies of multiple sclerosis (MS). To estimate WML volume there are a number of automatic segmentation methods, many of which are available in R, yet manual delineation remains the gold standard approach. These approaches often yield a probability map to which a threshold is applied to create lesion segmentation masks. Unfortunately, few approaches systematically determine the threshold employed; many methods use a manually selected threshold, thus introducing human error and bias into the automated procedure. We developed and validated an automatic thresholding algorithm, Thresholding Approach for Probability Map Automatic Segmentation in Multiple Sclerosis (TAPAS), to obtain subject-specific threshold estimates for probability map automatic segmentation of T2-weighted (T2) hyperintense WMLs. We implemented an R package, rtapas, to disseminate the approach for fitting the TAPAS model and predicting subject-specific thresholds for automatic segmentation. The rtapas package provides an intuitive and unified interface for its main functions to allow imaging statisticians and neurologists to automatically generate lesion segmentation masks from probability maps using subject-specific thresholds.";"poster"

However, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analysed, reported. One of the aspects often poorly reported - often not reported at all - is the Monte Carlo error of summary statistics, defined as the standard deviation of the estimated quantity over replications. Monte Carlo errors play a crucial role in understanding how results are affected by chance.
In order to aid researchers interested in running and analysing simulation studies, we developed rsimsum and INTEREST. rsimsum is an R package for analysing results from simulation studies: it computes the most common summary statistics and Monte Carlo errors are reported by default. INTEREST is a shiny app providing an interface to rsimsum, offering tools to analyse simulation studies interactively and export plots and tables of summary statistics for later use. rsimsum and INTEREST can aid investigating results from simulation studies and supplement the reporting of their results to a great extent, allowing researches to share the full results of their simulation study and readers to explore them freely and in a more engaging way.";"oral presentation"

The merlin package in R provides an extended framework for the analysis of a range of data types, encompassing any number of outcomes of any type, each of which could be repeatedly measured (longitudinal), with any number of levels and with any number of random effects at each level. Many standard distributions are described, as well as non-standard user-defined non-linear models. The extension focuses on a complex linear predictor for each outcome model, allowing sharing and linking between outcome models in a flexible way, either by linking random effects directly, or the expected value of one outcome (or function of it) within the linear predictor of another. Non-linear and time-dependent effects are also seamlessly incorporated to the linear predictor through the use of splines or fractional polynomials. merlin allows level-specific random effect distributions and numerical integration techniques to improve usability, relaxing the normally distributed random effects assumption to allow multivariate t-distributed random effects.

The objective was to describe patients' movements for a large Swiss University Hospital.    Methods Data from 2015 to 2017 were used containing patients' movements time and dates. With padr package, continuous time was extracted between each movement of the patient for an interval of 30 minutes. The first and last movements were recognized as admission and discharge, respectively. For the transfers, the use of the functions lead() and lag() from dplyr package were used. The goal was to identify for each unit if the patient was coming in or out. Finally, the amount of entries (admissions and transfers in) was plotted against exits (discharges and transfers out) on a pyramid bar chart using ggplot2 and scales packages.   Results Ten departments and 77 units were analyzed with 85,706 patients' observations. The final data comprised of more than 26 million data points. Patient flow varies considerably. While for some units entries and exits occur at the same time, other units have volatile periods with different times of the day where entries and exits occur leading to substantially variation in patient load.   Conclusion It is the first analysis of patient movements conducted on this level of granularity.";"oral presentation"

"Gui Raluca";"REndo: An R Package to Address Endogeneity Without External Instrumental Variables";"Endogeneity becomes a challenge when aiming to uncover causal relationships in empirical research. Reasons are manifold, i.e. omitted variables, measurement error or simultaneity. These might lead to the unwanted correlation between the independent variables and the error term of a statistical model. While external instrumental variables methods can be used to control for endogeneity, these approaches require additional information which is usually difficult to obtain. 

Internal instrumental variable (IIV) methods address this issue by treating endogeneity without the need of additional variables, taking advantage of the structure of the data. Implementations of IIV are rare. Thereby, we propose the R package ?REndo? that implements five instrument-free methods: the latent instrumental variables approach (Ebbes et al. 2005), the higher moments estimation (Lewbel 1997), the heteroskedastic error approach (Lewbel 2012), the joint estimation using copula (Park and Gupta 2012) and the multilevel GMM (Kim and Frees 2007).

Until recently, possible ways to report results were either to bring the text file after simulating the model that is tedious and time-consuming, or to use packages where the codes can only access the ABM platform, which slows the simulation speed (especially for geospatial models). Here, we use a newly released nlrx package that improves the modelling speed, iterates multiple jobs, and provides algorithms for temporal sequence plotting.

Methods: Fuzzy set and propositional fuzzy rules were employed to represent this ?contaminated needles force of viral infection? due the difficulty of values determination by experiments. To develop the system based on fuzzy rules, it used the minimum t-norm, Mandani's inferring t-conorms method, and centroid method to defuzzyfication operations. It applying fuzzy sets and nine propositional rules, this force of blood-contaminated needles infection was calculated. After, we assessed the simulation runs from an ODE epidemiological model employed to represent the viral infections and fuzzy rules constructed through fbrs, deSolve and pracma R packages.

However, fitting spatial and spatio-temporal models is not easy for non-expert users. Here, we present the interactive web application SSTCDapp for the analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal mortality (or incidence) data, which is addressed at https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/. The web application is designed to perform descriptive analyses in space and time of mortality risks or rates, and to fit an extensive range of fairly complex spatio-temporal models commonly used in disease mapping. The application is built with the R package shiny and relies on the well founded integrated nested Laplace (INLA) approximation technique for model fitting and inference. Unlike other software used in disease mapping, SSTCDapp provides an user-friendly interface that facilitates the fit of complex statistical models to non-experts users without the need of installing any software in their own computers, since all the analyses and computations are made in a powerful remote server. In addition, a desktop version is also available to run the application locally if needed, which avoids uploading the data to the online application fully guaranteeing data confidentiality.";"lightning talk"
"Onkelinx Thierry";"git2rdata: storing dataframes in a plain text format suitable for version control";"Base R has write.table() and read.table() to work with data in plain text files. Factors are stored as their labels, making them indistinguishable from characters and losing information on the levels. The git2rdata packages provides write_vc() which stores a dataframe as two plain text files: a tab separated file with the data and a metadata file in YAML format. The metadata stores the class of each variable and all other relevant metadata, e.g. the factor levels and their order. read_vc() reads the raw data using read.table() and restores the variables based on their metadata. Storing the metadata also allows to optimize the file storage, e.g. by storing factor indices rather than factor labels in the data file. This optimization can be turned of in case human readable data is preferred over smaller files. Git stores changes as row wise diffs. Swapping the order of two variables results in changing every single row of the plain text file. write_vc() avoids this be reordering the variables based on the existing metadata. Sorting the observations along user defined variables result in a stable row order. Metadata can be overridden if needed to accommodate a change in variables. git2rdata is useful to store and retrieve data in a reproducible workflow. Installation instructions, documentation and vignettes are available at https://inbo.github.io/git2rdata/";"oral presentation"

With the growing popularity of serverless computing frameworks that offer Functions-as-a-Service (like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) or Container-as-a-Service (ECS and ACI) we see a a huge chance to allow R developers to more easily deploy their code into production. We want to show you how you can use serverless computing to easily put models in production. We will discuss the pros and cons of various approaches and how we implemented a completely serverless data science platform for R in Microsoft Azure that you can arbitrarily scale (as long as your credit card allows:) up and down. While we come from an Azure background, porting the ideas over to AWS or Google Cloud should be straight forward.";"oral presentation"
"Rousseau David";"Ordinal clustering of seed populations with data extracted from RGB imaging and X-ray tomography";"Population of seeds with different genotypes are imaged in X-ray tomography before imbibition and with RGB imaging during imbibition. Morphological traits characterizing the shape and volume of suborgans are computed from the 3D X-ray images. Time of germination and germination speed is determined after processing RGB images. From these data a clustering based on K-mean and generalized mixture models is produced after dimension reduction with a principal component analysis. The analyzed genotypes are ordered from empirical knowledge of their agronomical values. The possibility to recover this ordinal relationship, without supervision, with the data extracted from the images is investigated. The purity of this ordinal clustering is analyzed with new simple metrics (distance class, genotype distance and associated standard deviation) made available under R functions. Fusion of data from RGB and X-ray tomography demonstrates good performances of prediction of the agronomical value. This is obtained on 7 genotypes of sugar beet with more than 10000 seeds analyzed.

Based on the framework detailed in López-Lopera et al. [SIAM/ASA JUQ, 6(03): 1224-1255, 2018], lineqGPR is an R package for GP regression modelling with inequality constraints. It can be used to create GP models under boundedness, monotonicity, convexity constraints or a combination of these. Furthermore, it also allows users to design their own sets of linear inequalities. lineqGPR contains all the typical features of classic GP libraries, e.g. the parameter estimation via maximum likelihood, support for noisy observations. Finally, recent developments allow the implementation of additive GP models under linear inequality constraints leading to models that can be used to the case of thousands of observations and to high dimensions.

lineqGPR is available on CRAN as an open-source software licensed under GNU GPL-3. It is based on previous R developments produced by the Deep Inside Computer Experiments (Dice) and ReDice Consortiums (e.g. DiceKriging, DiceDesign, kergp), but incorporating structures of classic GP libraries from other platforms (e.g. the GPmat toolbox from MATLAB, and the GPy library from Python).

"Zeileis Achim";"colorspace: A Toolbox for Manipulating and Assessing Color Palettes";"The R package ""colorspace"" (http://colorspace.R-Forge.R-project.org/) provides a flexible toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in statistical graphics and data visualizations. In particular, the package provides a broad range of color palettes based on the HCL (Hue-Chroma-Luminance) color space. The three HCL dimensions have been shown to match those of the human visual system very well, thus facilitating intuitive selection of color palettes through trajectories in this space.

Namely, general strategies for three types of palettes are provided: (1) Qualitative for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available and every color should receive the same perceptual weight. (2) Sequential for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e., going from high to low (or vice versa). (3) Diverging for coding ordered/numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes.

To aid selection and application of these palettes the package provides scales for use with ggplot2; shiny (and tcltk) apps for interactive exploration (see also http://hclwizard.org/); visualizations of palette properties; accompanying manipulation utilities (like desaturation and lighten/darken), and emulation of color vision deficiencies.

"Liquet Benoit";"PLS for Big Data: A Unified Parallel Algorithm for Regularized Group PLS";"Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been heavily exploited to analyze the association between two blocks of data. These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number of variables is greater than the number of observations and in the presence of high collinearity between variables.
Different sparse versions of PLS have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modeling is a key factor in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparse PLS methods is the link between the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix (constructed from deflated versions of the original data) and least squares minimization in linear regression. We review four popular PLS methods for two blocks of data. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four types of PLS including their regularised versions. We present various approaches to decrease the computation time and show how the whole procedure can be scalable to big data sets. The bigsgPLS R package implements our unified algorithm and is available at https://github.com/matt-sutton/bigsgPLS";"oral presentation"

Government agencies and ocean scientists are struggling to reduce the damage of coastal aquaculture by HABs. As a part of the effort, ocean scientists are conducting researches on how to cope with HABs and how to predict it before HABs occur. In this study, a model to predict the route and range of HABs was constructed to prevent damage caused by HABs. As with most ecological models, the major parts of the HABs model including physical, chemical, and biological factors are fundamental, but technical processes for efficient operation of the model are also important. The open source language, R, has a great advantage in performing comprehensive modeling research because a wide range of libraries which are well-verified can be available. Whole modeling processes including data acquisition using API(Application Programming Interface) from government, localized physical model data input, rasterizing and computing spatial data and visualization of prediction results were integrated into the R and implemented with satisfaction. The integrated R code calculates the 72-hour forecast results everyday through the batch process.";"poster"

"Gehrke Matthias";"Teaching Statistics for Data Literacy by the means of R mosaic and R Markdown";"Data and data analysis has never been as ubiquitous as it is today. However, such data abundance has triggered a surge in the complexity of data analyses. Therefore, statistical education can and should address both the current challenges and the opportunities of data analysis more thoroughly than it is currently the case.

Educators should teach all students ""data literacy"" which has been defined as ""the ability to collect, manage, evaluate, and apply data in a critical manner"" (Ridsdale et al. 2015). But as Gould (2017) already phrased it: data literacy ""is Statistical Literacy"".

The didactical concept we present here builds on three aspects - wherever possible with real-life applications. First, we employ concepts of modeling (Stigler & Son, 2018) including simulation based inference (Chance et al. 2016) using the R package mosaic (Pruim et al. 2017). It provides a simple and consistent coding interface for graphical and numerical modeling. Second, we show our students how to render an analysis reproducibly by using R Markdown (Baumer et al. 2014). Third, we demonstrate core theoretical concepts in interactive shiny apps (Doi et al. 2016). Following Wild et al. (2018), we hope to help our students ""to be able to learn about how our world operates using data, all the while acknowledging sources and levels of uncertainty"".

"Chan Rosa";"Comparing Mechanistic and Pre-clinical Predictions of Volume of Distribution on a Large Set of Drugs";"Volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) is a fundamental pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter and is believed to be predominantly driven by passive processes and physicochemical properties of the compound. For human prediction, Vdss can be estimated using in silico mechanistic methods or scaled from Vdss values obtained from preclinical species. A systematic comparison of these methods was performed to assess the relative predictivity with a sufficiently large data set, which is lacking in the current literature. The objective of this study is to compare preclinical and human Vdss with predictions resulting from a mechanistic in silico model based on experimental in vitro properties for a large dataset including over 150 marketed drugs. This assessment indicated that overall the in silico mechanistic model presented by Rodgers and Rowland is comparably accurate or superior to Vdss predictions based on direct proportionality between different species. While anions, neutral compounds and strong bases can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy, the data suggest that predictions for weak bases are generally poor. These results illustrate the great potential of mechanistic in silico models to predict Vdss, which do not rely on in vivo data and are, consequently, significantly time and resource saving.  ";"poster"

The place where interactions are the most frequent is in a web page. And Javascript is powerfull for adding behavior to a web page. To use it, all you need to do is to put the code in a HTML document and tell the browser that it is Javascript. The principal bridge between these two tools is the htmlwidgets package. In JAVA programming, JavaFX framework provides us a WebView component that can be used as an embedded web browser in a JavaFX application. This component handles most of the work of web browsing, for example in own concern, rendering the HTML content. Another advantage of embedding a web browser in the JAVA HMI is to offer the possibility to insert shiny applications and hence gaining a more complete control on the interactivity.

In two years, LatAm went from one to 29 R-Ladies active groups. English-only materials can be a barrier to R. Hence, LatAm R-Ladies led efforts to translate into Spanish: R for Data Science (es.r4ds.hadley.nz), R-Ladies code of conduct and policies (bit.ly/2UwP79x), and R Consortium 2017 (bit.ly/2Tpt8RR) and RStudio 2018 surveys. The creation of new regional conferences was another R-Ladies-led effort. Thanks to the R-Ladies network, LatinR (latin-r.com) got rapidly started and LatAm had its first SatRDay. Among other achievements, these events impulsed the regional community in the form of new and diverse R user groups (e.g., Rosario, Montevideo).

The BiclustGUI is an envelope package that interconnects 10 biclustering analysis and visualisation packages on a single platform. The current software targets multiple audiences: the R Commander plug-in is a point-and-click solution to explore different biclustering algorithms, but will also output the relevant R code. This is ideal for both experienced and beginning R users who want to switch to or learn about the underlying R code itself. For non-R users, a shiny application was developed as well. The final target audience are developers of new biclustering methods who are given the possibility to include new methods in the GUI with minimum support from the BiclustGUI's maintainer through easy template scripts.

"Friendly Michael";"Visualizing multivariate linear models in R";"This talk reviews our recent work in the development of visualization methods in R
for understanding and interpreting multivariate linear models (MLMs).

We begin with a description and examples of the HE plots framework, utilizing the
heplots package, wherein multivariate tests can be visualized via ellipsoids in 2D, 3D. HE
plots provide visual tests of significance: a term is significant by Roy's test if and only if its H
ellipsoid projects somewhere outside the E ellipsoid. 

These graphical methods apply equally to all multivariate designs: MMRA, MANOVA, and
MANCOVA, and the test of any linear hypothesis can also be displayed in an HE plot. 

When the rank of the hypothesis matrix for a term is 2 or more, these effects can also be
visualized in a reduced-rank canonical space via the candisc package, which also provides new
data plots for canonical correlation problems. These plots quite often provide a very simple
description of differences in means among groups in a MANOVA setting, by displaying the
projections of response variables as vectors in canonical space. We also describe some recent extensions of these ideas:

* We extend the visualization methods to robust MLMs.
* Influence measures and diagnostic plots for MLMs have now been implemented in the mvinfluence package.
* We develop visual tests of equality of covariance matrices for MANOVA.";"oral presentation"

At the R4DS community, we encourage diversity and contribution from everyone. We believe that no question is silly and no one is an island of knowledge. In this talk, we will be sharing the positive changes made since the transfer of leadership, our challenges, the lesson we have learnt and provide room for suggestion and opinions.";"oral presentation"
"Turcan Alexandra";"Data for all: Empowering teams with scalable Shiny applications";"Shiny, alongside packages like dplyr and ggplot2, offers an unparalleled developer experience for creating self-service analytics dashboards that empower teams to make data-driven decisions. However, out of the box, Shiny is not well-suited to deployment in a multi-user environment. As part of our mission to establish a data culture in a game development studio, we wanted to deploy a suite of Shiny dashboards such that exploring player behaviour became part of every team's workflow. In this talk, we will discuss the architecture of the supporting cloud infrastructure, including packaging, service orchestration, and authentication. Also, we will show how we've adapted Shiny to a multi-user environment using its new support for promises in combination with the future package. Integrating Shiny into this production-grade architecture allows for a streamlined data science workflow that enables data scientists to focus on creating dashboard content with a built-in code review process, and also to deploy changes to production in a button click. We hope to demonstrate how any data-driven organisation can augment their team-wide workflow by leveraging this end-to-end Shiny pipeline.";"oral presentation"
"Bossek Jakob";"Evolutionary Computation in R with the ecr Package";"Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are stochastic optimizers which mimick principles from Darwinian evolution theory in bits and bytes. A set of solution candidates, termed the population, is usually evolved in a loop of random recombination, mutation and selection operators. This broad class of algorithms has proven its effectiveness in many fields of research and applications with highly encouraging outcomes. EAs are particularly successful in tackling (combinatorial) problems with large (disrete) search spaces, little knowledge about the problem domain and/or multiple conflicting objectives (multi-objective optimization). Corresponding applications in statistical data analysis incorporates, e.~g., feature/variable selection in machine learning, model selection, cluster analysis to name a few. Basically all EAs are composed of a sequence of operators and building blocks which are evaluated repeatedly within a loop. The R package ecr provides a framework for building custom evolutionary algorithms in R. Many predefined building blocks, e.g., operators, logging procedures, facilitate the implementation of algorithmic ideas. The package has been conceived as a white-box framework which encourages to user to write the evolutionary loop by hand for maximal flexibility. This poster gives a brief overview of ecr' functionality by its lead developer.";"poster"
"Mierzwa-Sulima Olga";"Best practices for building Shiny enterprise applications";"Shiny is conquering the enterprise world. Shiny apps are now built for hundreds of users who need reliability and functionality. Having built and scaled a number of Shiny applications in production, we've learned what's important for a Shiny app to become a stunning success. We'd like to share our experiences with you. This presentation will give you a deep dive into the best practices for building Shiny production apps, including: * how to design app architecture for optimal maintainability and development velocity; * approaches for avoiding errors in production; * test pyramid: why it pays off to have automated end-to-end tests and unit tests, and how to minimize manual testing; * how to scale Shiny apps to hundreds of users and set up automated performance testing; * deployment strategies and the path from deployment, involving many manual steps, to full automation. Shiny allows you to rapidly iterate on functionality and build impressive dashboards, but it's not easy to do a great job getting that through to production. In this talk, we will discuss what specific steps you can take to achieve reliability without sacrificing speed of development.";"oral presentation"
"Aguirre V.";"BAYESDEF an R Based Graphical Interface to Analyze Definitive Screening Designs";"Definitive Screening Designs (DSD) are a class of experimental designs that have the possibility to estimate linear, quadratic and interaction effects with relatively little experimental effort. The linear or main effects are completely independent of two factor interactions and quadratic effects. The two factor interactions are not completely confounded with other two factor interactions, and quadratic effects are estimable. The number of experimental runs is twice the number of factors of interest plus one. In this work we present an R based graphical interface that performs a sequential Bayesian analysis of DSD's. In the first step only main effects are considered, then in the next steps quadratic an interaction effects are added. The decision rules consider an effect as significant if the posterior odds that the effect is active is grater that some predetermined value. The procedure is calibrated so that the overall experiment wise error rate is kept at 10%. The programming of the interface makes use of the gWidgets package.";"poster"

We have implemented this API in the extensively tested safepredict package, and will demonstrate workflows that emphasize uncertainty calculations and integration with other tidymodels packages.";"lightning talk"
"Allard Tania";"Everything star wars has taught me about data science";"Every day we interact with data, which is collected in a number of ways and feeds thousands of algorithms (or machine learning models). Never has machine learning or data science had this much potential for good, improvement of services and processes or marginalisation of specific populations or groups. At the same time, research now mostly depends on software and automated (or semi-automated) data analyses to generate knowledge. This places a huge responsibility on the researchers and data scientist to ensure that their work is transparent, robust an reproducible. In this talk, we will dive into techniques to ensure your data work complies with these standards, whether it is at an R&D stage or in a production environment, serving customers and consumers. I will use inspiration from movies and characters from Star Wars to present the concepts of this talk to make this more memorable The outline looks something like this: - Introduction (me and the topic) - Shared understanding: what do reproducibility and transparency even mean?  - Early stages of a project: what to consider for a reproducibility first approach - Development stages: keeping your code and data quality as they evolve - Data lineage and provenance: what are these and why do they matter? - My model is ready to ship/be published, what now? - Standing the weight of time: is my project sustainable? robust? is it decaying? - Summarise the main points ";"lightning talk"
"Nowosad Jakub";"How to win friends and write an open-source book";"Over the last few years, a quiet revolution has been brewing in the R book publishing industry. Since the publication of early open source books, such as Advanced R (published in 2014), many authors have switched to a hybrid system, in which books are published online and in print. This approach has several advantages, including (1) people can choose how to read the book, online or in print, and make an informed decision before buying it; (2) the book retains the process of reviews and professional copy-editing provided by publishers; (3) the wider community can contribute, leading to many improvements in the code and text. Several developments have enabled this revolution, including the bookdown package, online version control services (e.g., GitHub), continuous integration services (e.g., Travis CI), and many more. This talk will share our experience of writing the open source book Geocomputation with R (https://geocompr.github.io/). We will show how to start writing an open-source book, which tools are useful, and how to collaborate on a large project while being a continent apart. We will also point out a few issues in the process, and how we navigated them. Overall, we advocate writing an open source book and hope the talk will be useful to others thinking about starting such a project.";"oral presentation"
"Harner Jim";"xstatR: an Environment for Running R and XLISP-STAT in Docker Containers";"R is the lingua franca of statistical computing, but it lacks a strong API for interactive, dynamic graphics. Shiny and ggvis are excellent, but they do not support dynamic actions (brushing, geodesic rotations, etc.). XLISP-STAT and R were the dominant computing and graphics platforms in the nineties and early 2000s, but it became clear that only a single open source platform was viable and the community chose R. However, it is now common to use multiple platforms, e.g., R and Spark or R and Python. xstatR in an environment that combines R and XLISP-STAT within a single Docker container (https://github.com/jharner/xstatR). R and XLISP-STAT run as separate Linux processes in a container with a bridge between them, which allows saved R objects to be translated into Lisp objects (or vice versa). Models typically are built in R and exploratory and diagnostic dynamic plots are created in XLISP-STAT. Since XLISP-STAT also supports windows, menus, etc., a graphical interface has been developed which obviates the need for users to learn Lisp. Prototype XLISP-STAT packages have been built for model-based interactive diagnostic plots, multivariate visualizations, and GGobi-type dynamic graphs. The xstatR container can be deployed locally or to any cloud service, e.g., AWS. We are refactoring xstatR to run XLISP-STAT as a subprocess of R, which will allow XLISP-STAT to more-directly access R objects.";"oral presentation"
"Alfons Andreas";"Robust mediation analysis using the R package robmed";"Mediation analysis is one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social and behavioral sciences. In its simplest form, a mediation model allows to study how an independent variable (X) affects a dependent variable (Y) through an intervening variable that is called a mediator (M). Such an analysis is often carried out via a pair of regression models, in which case the indirect effect of X on Y through M can be computed as a product of coefficients from those regression models. The standard test for this indirect effect is a bootstrap test based on ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. However, this test is very sensitive, e.g., to outliers or heavy tails, which poses a serious threat to empirical testing of theory about mediation mechanisms. The R package robmed implements a robust test for mediation analysis based on the fast and robust bootstrap methodology for robust regression estimators. This procedure yields reliable results for estimating the effect size and assessing its significance, even when the data deviate from the usual normality assumptions. In addition to simple mediation models, the package also provides functionality for mediation models with multiple mediators as well as control variables. Furthermore, the standard bootstrap test and other proposals are included in the package. We will demonstrate the use of package robmed in an example from management research.";"oral presentation"
"Berel Dror";"Bioc2mlr: R package to bridge between Bioconductor's S4 complex genomic data container, to mlr, a meta machine learning aggregator package.";"Bioconductor's S4 data containers for genomic assays are popular, well established data structures. Their data architecture facilitates the application of common analytical procedures and well established statistical methodologies to large assay data. They are extensible to encompass new emerging technologies and analytical methods.

However, the S4 system enforces strict constraints on the data and these constraints raise barriers for interoperability and integration with software and packages outside of Bioconductor's repository.

Mlr is a comprehensive package for machine learning. It aggregates hundreds of supervised and unsupervised models and facilitates analytics such as resampling, benchmarking, tuning, and ensemble. The mlrCPO package extends mlr's pre-processing and feature engineering functionality via composable Preprocessing Operators (CPO) 'pipelines'.

Bioc2mlr is a compact utility package designed to bridge between these approaches. It deploys transformations of SummarizedExperiment and MultiAssayExperiment S4 data structures into mlr's expected format. It also implements Bioconductor's popular feature selection (filtering) methods used by limma and others, as a CPO. The vignettes present comparisons to the MLInterfaces package, which aims to achieve similar goals, and presents workflows for popular public datasets such as curatedTCGAData.";"oral presentation"

"Lovelace Robin";"R for Transport Planning";"Since the first release of R on CRAN, in 1997, its use in many fields has grown rapidly. Lai et al. (2019), for example, suggest that more than 50% of research articles published in Ecology use R in some way. Much like many ecological datasets, transport data tend to be large, diverse and have spatial and temporal attributes. Unlike Ecology, Transport Planning has been a slow adopter of R, with a much lower percentage of papers using the language. This raises the question: why? After exploring this question, in relation to dominant transport planning software products, the talk will sketch of what an open source transport planning 'ecosystem' could look like. Based on my own experience, of developing the stplanr package and teaching practitioners, the talk will discuss the importance of building ?communities of practice', for transport planners making the switch to R. These observations relate to others promoting R in new environments, and link to the wider question of how to advocate for open source software in wider society.

A Consistent Interface Across Development Environments";"This talk will cover the development of RCocoa (https://github.com/StatTag/rcocoa), a library written in Objective-C that provides a bridge to R. Similar to existing libraries such as RInside for C++ and R.NET for C#, RCocoa integrates the R engine into an application written in Objective C. RCocoa enables developers to more easily port Windows applications written with R.NET to macOS. We wrote RCocoa as part of our development of StatTag (http://stattag.org), an open source, user-friendly program to support reproducible research. Due to design considerations, StatTag was developed for Windows in C# using R.NET, and in Objective-C for macOS. RCocoa allowed us to maintain a consistent interface to R across both platforms. We will discuss the development and use of RCocoa, focusing on similarities to R.NET. Using our development of StatTag as an exemplar use case, we will describe how other developers may incorporate RCocoa into their own projects. ";"poster"

"Wirhaspati Novia Listiyani";"Optimization in R: Black-Box Optimization for Problem with Time Dimension";"There are many examples where we can only evaluate without explicit equation. In such cases, black-box optimization has enormous potentials. We demonstrate its capability in the business world - especially in the case of purchasing item(s) with dynamic pricing. Roughly speaking, we need to adjust the amount of money spent and its allocation within the next few periods. Prophet is employed to be the simple-yet-scalabale black-box function, through which we can predict future cost of purchased item(s) given amount of money spent. Denote that the objective of this problem is to minimize the total of cost per purchased item(s). The black-box function is optimized using SACOBRA package, where the objective comes with business constraints such as minimum purchase level, maximum cost to pay, etc. SACOBRA uses radial basis function (RBF) to interpolate objective function and constraint(s). More importantly, it can repair solution where constraint(s) is violated ? that SACOBRA can perform well against business problem and its numerous constraints. The result in implementing SACOBRA is good. Furthermore, for 3 different items in the next 7 days, it takes around 6 hours to converge. This initial study strongly indicates that SACOBRA can revolutionize decision making process in the business world as it allows us to get the optimal decision within the feasible region by only providing black-box function.";"oral presentation"
"Dai Zhuo Jia";"You don't need Spark for this - larger-than-RAM data manipulation with disk.frame";"R is blessed with the very best data munging tools such as dplyr and data.table. However, R requires data to be loaded to RAM in the form of a data.frame; and a corollary of this is that R cannot deal with larger-than-RAM data easily. This talk introduces the disk.frame package which is designed to manipulate ""medium"" data - those datasets that are too large to fit into RAM but can be manipulated on a single machine with the right tools. In a nutshell, disk.frame makes use of two simple ideas to make larger-than-RAM data manipulation feasible * split up a larger-than-RAM dataset into chunks and store each chunk in a separate file inside a folder and
* provide a convenient API to manipulate these chunks Furthermore, disk.frame optimises on-disk data manipulation * by using state-of-the-art data storage format provided by the fst package to efficiently read and write data to disk
* by parallelizing operations with the excellent future package
* by using the data.table package's fast algorithms for grouping and merging Finally, disk.frame supports many dplyr-verbs to make it accessible to useRs who are already familiar with dplyr.";"oral presentation"

"Sachs Michael";"Machine learning for censored event history data using pseudo-observations";"There are many powerful implementations of machine learning procedures in R, yet many of them are focused on binary or continuous outcomes. Censored event history data is common in biomedical research, and pseudo-observations is a powerful approach to modeling possibly censored event history data with or without competing risks. Pseudo observations replace incompletely observed event history processes with jackknifed nonparametric estimates of marginal estimands so that standard regression methods can be used to estimate conditional quantities. The calculation of pseudo observations is a data pre-processing step that allows any and all machine learning procedures to be used for censored time to event outcomes with or without competing risks. We develop a suite of loss functions that are useful targets in the context of prediction of time to event outcomes, such as the area under the time varying ROC curve, and illustrate how they can be used with current R packages for machine learning. We also show how to evaluate the performance and operating characteristics of the estimated models also using the pseudo observations to provide unbiased estimates of quantities such as the cumulative cause specific incidence and restricted mean survival.";"poster"

An optimal solution to the problem via linear programming is available. Due to the computational costs involved, this is not a feasible solution for large problems. A quick approximation is given by the greedy algorithm. This talk introduces RcppGreeySetCover, an implementation of the greedy set cover algorithm using Rcpp. The implementation is fast due to the reliance on efficient data structures made available by the Boost headers and the C++ 11 standard library. Preprocessing of input data is done efficiently via the data.table package.
