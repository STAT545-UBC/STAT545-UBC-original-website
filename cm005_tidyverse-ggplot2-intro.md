### cm005 2016-09-20 Tuesday overview

  * You should submit [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html) sometime today!
    - Get help in class [office hours](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/312) if you're struggling.
  * Peer review will be set in motion soon via Issues. I'll announce via [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) so you'll know when to look for notification.
  * Homework 02 due before class next Tuesday 2016-09-27. It will be a lightly refreshed version of 2015's [Homework 02](hw02_explore-gapminder-use-rmarkdown.html).
  * Today. I will be drawing from (and then revising) these topics:
    - Care and feeding of data frames -- or tibbles! -- with the [`tidyverse`](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse)
    - Slides with very simple view of some R objects [on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/simple-view-of-r-objects)
    - [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block006_care-feeding-data.html)
    - [Introduction to dplyr](block009_dplyr-intro.html)
    - [`dplyr` functions for a single dataset](block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html)
    - Indicative code from this week's live coding in class: [`cm005_hello-gapminder-tidyverse.R`](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/cm005_hello-gapminder-tidyverse.R)
  * Read the "Explore" chapters in [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)
