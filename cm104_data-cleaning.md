### cm104 2015-11-05 Thursday overview

  * HW07 due Wednesday November 11
    - Bring the Candy Survey data -- or part of it -- to a ready-to-analyze state and do basic exploration.
    - It is vital that you **finish some task**, nachos to cheesecake. We want a bit of story, some tables, some figures. Keep scaling back the cleaning and reshaping until you can manage this. Then scale up til you run out of time or patience.
    - We might add an optional regex exercise.
    
  * The candy survey data is available:
    - on GitHub: <https://github.com/jennybc/candy>
    - look in [data-raw](https://github.com/jennybc/candy/tree/master/data-raw)
    - specifically [data-raw/00_explore-raw.R](https://github.com/jennybc/candy/blob/master/data-raw/00_explore-raw.R) will get you started and poses some challenges
  * Today will be all live coding and helping you get traction on HW07.
  * I definitely want to spend some time on two-table operations, so we'll probably go here:
    - [Cheatsheet for `dplyr` join functions](bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html)
